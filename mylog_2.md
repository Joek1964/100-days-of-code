# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 14 August 2017

**Today's Progress:** Restarted my count for the #100DaysOfCode because I had missed Friday and Sunday. I decided to stick to the rules and rather restart instead of cheating myself in the end. I got through the basics of JavaScript variables and operators. Before restarting, I did complete my fCC Personal Portfolio Page.

**Thoughts:** As simple as they variables and operators are, they are very important as they are the basis of JavaScript logic, in my thinking. I think it is also very important to **PLAN** your time effciently because you will easily miss the time for your coding and before you know it, you will go **DAYS** without coding. I'm glad I got back quickly and not have given too much time. I will continue daily to learn and build projects as that is the promise I made to myself.
