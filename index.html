            The last days were a disaster. I was busy with things, couldn't code. So, I don't count them for this challenge. I'm on day 15 now (otherwise 17). Yesterday I asked on Twitter: What should I learn? (JavaScript, Sass/sccs, jQuery or Web design). And it is 80% JavaScript, 20% Web Design. So the next days/week I'm focusing on JavaScript on FCC, Codecademy and Khanacademy.

            log from someone. And I get a lot of ideas, so I worked them out. There were also a lot of unnecessary things (like divs or classes that I don't need anymore), so I went through each line of code to find and delete them. This new page is the result.
            
                <br>
            And because I had time over, I did the jQuery course again on FreeCodeCamp.

            Started with the Build a personal portfolio webpage project from FCC. (which I hope can finish tomorrow) Did a part of the Responsive Design with Bootstrap again. Search some sites for designs, I found 
            
                <a href="http://coolors.co" class="link" target="_blank">Coolers</a>.
            
            Which is fantastic because I'm not creative enough to find colors on my own. I use  a 
            
                <a href="http://hackerthemes.com/bootstrap-cheatsheet"  class="link" target="_blank">cheatsheet</a>

            I had two coding sessions, one in the afternoon and one in the evening. When I wanted to start with the Build a personal portfolio project, I found a file from August. It looked terrible. So I deleted, things so I can start again. My afternoon session was a bit searching for old resources/tutorials, my evening session was making the portfolio webpage and was very productive.

            Starting with basics of my website project. I'm using 
            
                <a href="http://000webhost.com" class="link" target="_blank">Webhost</a> 
            
            for hosting, and linked as an FTP Server to my computer. I think I can start with code tomorrow (finally).

            Need to learn things again because I haven't done it a while. Like how to use an external css stylesheet. I looked to my FreeCodeCamp map, I am working on JavaScript, but I'm going to do a lot of things again. Because I don't know it anymore.

            Today I started with the challenge, and set things up. 
            
                <br> 
                <br>
                
            So I downloaded  
            
                <a href="http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/download" class="link" target="_blank">SmartGit</a> 
            
            because I am using 
            
                <a href="http://linuxmint.com"  class="link" target="_blank">Linux Mint</a> 
            
            and I wanted a GUI git. And this works for me. I use 
            
                <a href="http://brackets.io" class="link" target="_blank">Brackets</a>
            
            as Code editor, with a lot of plugins. 
            
                <br>
                <br>

            My main project is to make a personal website. So besides Github,I am going to create a website. If you like, you can track my progress there if you want.
            
                <br>
                <br>

            So not a lot of code yet. But I'm very exciting.

            Happy New Year!!!
            
                <br>
            
            So today I start with the #100DaysOfCode challenge.
            
                <br>
                <br>
            
            One of my goals for this challenge is making a personal website with all my projects and other things on it.
            
                <br>
            
            I'm only a bit familiar with HTML/CSS so I want to learn Javascript and other things so I can create better websites in 2017.
