 <strong>Today's Progress:</strong>
 *Setup a boiler plate to practice on.  
 *Setup Github #100daysofCode log for round 2
 *I took ten minutes to do a Markdown Tutorial at [www.markdowntutorial.com](www.markdowntutorial.com)
 *Setup Goals for this round
 *JavaScript & NodeJS Practice - made a boiler plate to work from on Express & React for now. 
 *Also working on Socket.IO features, namespaces, rooms & different implementations. 
    - I'll make a different Repo to track it for easier file keeping.  
 
 <strong>Goals:</strong>
 *Improve my Javascript Skillset: 
      -specifically Complete the [Udacity JavaScript Free Tutorial](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-javascript--ud803) 
      -Also [Udacity JavaScript Design Patterns Tutorial](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-design-patterns--ud989)
      -Pick up where I left off in [www.Freecodecamp.org](www.freecodecamp.org) 
        *aiming to finish up to Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification (300hours) - we will see how far I get for that one.
 *Learn more about APIs
 *Learn more about NodeJS
 *This Round, I'll show more of my work here in Github.
 *I'll work on my documentation skills in the process.
 *I'll make it a point not to let this round's Github journal fall to the wayside like the last round.  
 
 
 <strong>In today's closing thoughts:</strong>
      So that's a lot, but I think its doable.  I have done a lot of the tasks in the FreeCodecamp already from other parts of my last project, 
      so I'll see what actually stuck with me. My ultimate goal is to have an organized repo to show my work & learn to solve & think in terms of
      programming on my own.  So, I might have a number of small projects in here within this 100 days, depending on what the tutorials call for & 
      what I'm working on.  Right now, I know the very basics of JavaScript and some of its frameworks.  My goal is to understand them well enough 
      to explain what I am doing in my code & boost my confidence in writing my own code. Most of my  day, I'm either watching a tutorial, writing 
      code or reading about it, since before I started #100daysofCode, so the hour minimum will not be a problem. So, here I go again.
