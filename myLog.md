<h1>100 Days Of Code - Log</h1>
<h4>I am working on a project for a client and a few personal projects.  I will post my personal projects here, and any non-sensitive work here.
My current focus is web development.  I am getting familiar with the front end, and have a long way to go before I even master the fundamentals.
However, I am also learning some of the backend.  I have worked with html/css/javascript, which are the basics.  
I am  currently working on some PHP, mySQL and nodejs, and deciding which languages to use in which parts of my sites and web applications.
Seemingly, I can use php or nodejs for similar tasks.  The difference is that php is synchronous and node is asynchronous.  Each has its own benefits.  
NodeJS is mostly used in real-time applications, while PHP is used for more CPU-intense functions.  There is much more to these, but I may or may not cover them later in this log. 
It depends on my project and what I did that day.

<strong>Today's Progress:**</strong> I did a little bit of review in Freecodecamp.org (not much). I learned how to use github a little bit better. I looked up information about the NPM module "Forever" for node.js for a project that I am working on. I did some bracket notation and concatenation for javascript. I built the webmail access feature for a backend office tool that I am building for a client. I did about 4 hours of code study and one hour of actual code.

<strong>Thoughts:**</strong> Code study does not count as actual code. However, I have to look up information to actually get the code done. Does that count towards my coding time?

<Strong>Link to work:*</strong> The code for the project is private for a client. I will begin to add code here as a git-commit to a new repo. I will add that to my to do list for this challenge.
It is not all that eloborate or special, but I just need to protect it for now.  Still a newb, don't want to lose the security aspect of it.  I'll post a version of it later that does not include any credentials.  


<h2>Day 1: May 17, 2018: Thursday</h2>

<strong>Today's Progress:*</strong>  Here I learned a little bit about styling the markdown files here.  I will add more later today to this day 1 section.  So, it's later...I did a lot of reading and a tutorial on NodeJS (which does not count towards my coding hour, but it was still part of my process for the day.  I have to build a project to work on for this challenge log so I have some code that I can show.  For my code, I did a NodeJS, mySQL connection for a client's web app/site.  I also worked on some of the front end features for the site.  


<strong>Thoughts:**</strong> How do I make a new file pretty here in GitHub?  Do I have to use HTML/CSS to make it pretty?  That is going to be what I find out later today.  

<Strong>Thoughts:**</strong>  I need to pick a project for GitHub for this 100daysofcode challenge, still.   

<strong>Link(s) to work:</strong> Just this and Twitter for now.  @Audrey_Lin_D  
So

<h2>Day 2: May 18, 2018: Friday</h2>

<strong>Today's progress:**</strong> I worked more on my NodeJS project for my coding hours.  But, I did a lot of other code related stuff that needed attention.  I linked my GitHubDesktop and GitHub files to WAMP.  I did a little bit of review on multidimensional arrays, and reviewed the .push and .pop functions in Javascript.  I set up a repo for learning algorithms.  I'll be working on that, along with "Cracking the Coding Interview", "Algorithms for Dummies", and some online resources. 

<strong>Thoughts:**</strong>I am trying to create a little more structure and organization to my learning path and web development schedules.  I feel like I am never going to learn it all...but I am making progress...and by the time I master NodeJS, there will probably be something else I need to learn instead, or in addition...but I think that might be the fun part of it. That, and a lot of legacy type languages, frameworks and libraries are still relevant for their respective purpose and project types.  It will just be part of my toolkit later, right?  ...Right.  Lol.


<h2>Day 3: May 19, 2018: Saturday</h2>
<strong>Today's Progress:**</strong>  Today, I went to a baby shower, so I did not get any real-code done. I did fit an hour in to catch up on Freecodecamp.  I was doing my study online with other resources, so my freecodecamp was looking a bit sad.  Also, I started further back than where I left off, bc I couldn't figure out something the last time, so I deleted my progress at a certain point, so I wanted to add it back into the progress bar.  Also, I constantly struggle with spacing syntax in the Freecodecamp's editor...of all things....lol.  I barely made my hour of code before midnight today, I forgot that weekend plans could get in the way of my code.  I usually code through the weekend around the kids and family stuff, but I am allowed a day or two break on my other project.  This challenge is to keep a 100 day streak, so I have to make sure I fit it in.==Noted.  But, I will have to plan it better next time. There's a lot of project/self management in coding...even when you are just learning by yourself.   

<strong>Thoughts:**</strong> So, I was looking for a project to do on Github for this challenge....and then I read the resources and found code ideas...lol.  So, that's good.  I will need that to add to my skill set display anyway, since I cannot display all of my other project in here.  And one of my other websites was a Muse/Dreamweaver project, but I didn't write much code on that one.  I just slapped it together with some stuff to get it out there for an MVP.  So, I am also working on coding that one properly.  Then, I had a third one that is in wordpress, but I plan on modifying the code for that in Wordpress with some PHP and Laravel when I finish this NodeJS project I have been working on.  I am moving way slower than I would like, but I have to make sure I have a functional app to release, and I keep breaking it in different places, bc I'm still nit picking information that I need instead of understanding all the code overall...so it is taking me way longer than it should.  But, I am working to make the fundamentals a priority this month, and then getting more into the advanced stuff in better detail.  Right now, I am huntin and peckin at it as I learn.  So, I have a little schedule, but sometimes I move backwards or spend a ton of time looking up information in random resources about nodejs in addition to the npm modules.  I am not familiar with a lot of things, even in some of the Javascript.  So, it is eating up my time.  I guess you can't learn things over night, but I sure wish I could learn faster.  Learning by doing is how I learn the fastest, though.  So, continuing on this little syllabus/schedule I have re-structured.  I'll spend a bit of time in each section for easier progress measurement.  

<h2>Day 4: May 20, 2018 Sunday</h2>
<strong>Today's Progress:**</strong> I did one hour of FreeCodeCamp for coding today. I passed where I left off before I went backward in the path to review, and I only have 34 more exercises before I get to the Object Oriented and Functional Programming section.  As far as other activities related to coding, I am looking into the resources.md file of this challenge. I discovered it yesterday.  I have been wondering what I need to do for a project, but I guess I should have read through all of the files sooner, lol.  I skimmed them all the first day, but didn't really pay attention to all of it.  Lol.  I was doing a lot of code related things today, but not actually coding.  I was working on my NodeJS project.  I was looking for some deployment information and learning about Stripe implementation.  I also came across a few good Medium articles and a GitHub repo about licensing.  I won't post the Medium articles here, but you can find a lot of really helpful articles on Medium.com for a variety of related topics.

   The Github Repo for the licensing, you can learn more about at https://choosealicense.com/ or https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com.  I don't really need this right now, but it is good to have for later.  There were also some other links for this https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-license-to-a-repository/ , and https://blog.github.com/2013-07-15-choosing-an-open-source-license/ . 
   
   Also, I came across Github Education.  I was curious.  (I've already graduated and do not qualify for the free account.  I'll probably sign up to it later.)  Anyway, I wanted to see what was included in the student developer pack, just to see what to look into. 
   This pack is to help "ship software like a pro".  The tools included in this pack include: 
   *ATOM (A customizable text editor) - This is a free text editor.  In my opinion, it is a powerful editor, and I like it.  However, I use Visual Studio Code for now.  
   *AWS educate: Access to the AWS cloud, free training & Collaboration resources.  
   *Bitnami: Gives you the business 3 plan free for the year. This helps you to install cloud apps easily.
   *Cart (data analysis tool)
   *CrowdFunder 
   *DataDog
   *Digital Ocean (I hear lots of great things about Digital Ocean.)
   *Flatiron School
   *GitHub
   *GitKraken
   *Hackhands
   *Microsoft Imagine
   *NameCheap (Domain name & SSL cert free for a year)
   *SendGrid (Email Infrastructure as a Service)
   *Sentry (Polygot error tracker, framework, & library.
   *Stripe
   *Taplytics (Dynamic a/b testing)
   *Thinkful (WebDev lessons)
   *tansifex : localization access
   *Travis CI : Continuous Integration
   *Unreal Engine: Game Dev tools for multiplatforms
   
   All of these are included in the student pack.  I just wanted to see what was being used.  I am aware of some, but not all of these.  I want to look more into them as I need them.  I am working on implementing Stripe into my current NodeJS project for my client.  
   
   <strong>Thoughts: **</strong> I spend a lot of time on distractions, but mostly ones that are related to development.  However, I have implemented the pomodoro timer, so if I want to look more into something that I find while I am supposed to be coding, I'll just bookmark it and come back to it, unless it is directly related to my code session.  Learning focus is probably a huge factor to getting anything right or done in code, for sure.  I know there are focus extensions to keep you from browsing away from your task, but I am not necessarily going to other random sites, bc I wasn't coding, but I leave my code to find more information to better or fix it. So, I am adding that to my list of things to work on. 
   
  <h2>Day 5: May 21, 2018 Monday</h2>
  
  <strong>Today's Progress</strong> Day 5: Worked 5 hours on my node app today.  Lots of search/reading/trial/error: still poundin' away at it.  Today at lunch, I took a break to work on my site, but went back to my node app after a half hour.  After dinner: looked into #AngularJS, then my app again.
  
  <strong>Thoughts: </strong> Need to get done.  
  
  <h2>Day 6: May 22, 2018 Tuesday</h2>
  
  <strong>Today's Progress</strong>  I was not at my laptop today for most of today.  But, I studied different types of #functions #Javascript on my phone.  When I got home, I worked on @freeCodeCamp & my node app.  I also reviewed code on Github for reference and examples of #node #stripe.  
  
  <strong>Thoughts**</strong>I want to get done with FreeCodeCamp's basic JavaScript section already.  I think I am going to set my goal to be at 216 (starting ObjectOriented and Functional Programming) in the tutorials by Sunday night.  I have been doing only a couple of problems at a time, but only because I went looking for more resources, online, for those topics.  So, I was working on them, and working to understand them more clearly for myself, not just to get them done.  I think that is the only way it will stick for me...that and reusing that concept in my code frequently.  
  
  <h2>Day 7: May 23, 2018 Wednesday</h2>
  
  <strong>Today's Progress**:</strong> I worked on the Node site all day.  I looked into the Stripe payment system.  I am working on implementing it into my site/chat.  I got tired of working on that part of the site, so I started making the back office/access to the clients for the staff today.  I will make the access on a subdomain.  I spent some time to work out what features will be needed on both the user and admin side (front and back end's of both).  
  
  <strong>Thoughts**:</strong>  This project is for a startup.  I have done everything with the owner in deciding what is needed to get up and running and what other possibilities might be implemented in the future.  I am building this whole thing by myself.  I feel lost most of the time, but I have found a lot of really helpful books, websites and video tutorials that have been very helpful.  
  Stackoverflow and Google are my biggest allies.  I like Traversy Media, MMTuts and Coding Live w/ Jesse.  Devtips & FunFunFunction are also capturing a lot of my attention when I have time that I am not having to actually code.  Most of my time is going to research and planning.  But, I still have a great deal of code done for the users front & back end.  I have everything done for the site, except for chat and the stripe. I need to finish those, and tie them together.  
  I am looking for the best way to tie all of these pieces together, based on what I have and what I know.  However, I keep finding more and more information that might be relevant, but I try to be selective of what I spend my time on. It is very easy for me to get distracted by trying to learn something new, only to find I won't be using it in my current app.  
  I am loving all the new things that are ahead of me, and how I can implement them.  I need to be sure to stay focused.  As I learn more, and do more, it feels better and easier.  That, however, does not keep me from finding new things I have to/want to learn.  I think I need to start repo's for all the things that I am working on, even if it isn't code (because I found MIT Opencourseware).  I have actually known about it for a while, and watch the video lectures sometimes.  I think that I want to do a set time of when I do the course and take them in order to completion.  I have seen about 5 or 6 tracks that I have been meaning to complete.  I can do it like my old school schedule. I think their website has the problem sets available.  
  I also want to work on codefights &&|| codewars.  See?!  All the things...lol.  I need to prioritize them.  I might do a video lecture per day after I finish this app.  I will start codewars/codefights when I get past the Algorithms section in Freecodecamp.  I learned my JavaScript from w3schools, and I just started reading Javascript and Jquery by Jon Duckett. I will open a repo for my study journal/schedule.  Maybe I will make it a part of my #100daysofcode mid-R1 or #100daysofcode R2...Oh yes...there will be a round two!!  Too much to do and learn for there not to be a round-2.  Lol. 
  
<h2>Day 8: May 24th 2018 Thursday</h2>
<strong>Today's Progress**</strong>
Did more work on the #stripe #nodejs element of back office stuff that I have been working on.  I'll probably be focused on this for the week.  I coded the #FrontEnd #UI of the back office.  I started a Skype Bot Project with Bama for MC Vanilla High on a GitHub Repo &amp; Trello.  

<strong>Thoughts**</strong> I need to create a more readable log format.  This is getting too long to read. Maybe bullet points would be better? Hmmm...I think I like this format for my own review purposes for now. 


<h2>Day 9: May 25, 2018 Friday</h2>
<strong>Today's Progress**</strong> Today I worked on my nodeapp and embedding the email into the site from webmail.  I am working on connecting the chat between a domain for the main site chat and a subdomain for the staff to use the chat.  I think I will just link one of their pages to the link on the domain to sign-in, and make it the only place to access that page for the staff from their subdomain, so there wont be anyone trying to login in on the wrong place.  For now, I think I am going to manually add the staff users, for security purposes.  This way not just anyone can signup to be considered staff if they are able to access that page.  I can add them manually, and they can only access everything if I put them in the system myself.  I will find a more relevant solution later.  I can add a registry sign up, like on the main domain, but I think I might wait to see what I find first.   Also, once this project is done, I might make a repo of the project, without the sensitive information.  

I took a few small breaks today, but spent them learning about build tools, such as Gulp, Grunt and WebPack. 

<strong>Thoughts:**</strong>  I have a lot to learn, but the more I learn, the more I learn about the list of growing things that I don't know and feel like I should know.  Lol.  I feel like I need to know everything, I know I don't, but I should be open to learning more.  I think the most important thing for me right now is to focus on the task in front of me for now.  I know that this is for the #100daysofcode challenge, but I will have no problem going beyond the 100 days...

<h2>Day 11: May 27th 2018, Sunday</h2>

<strong>Today's Progress:**</strong>
Day11 #100DaysOfCode I did more reading and searching than coding this morning.  I re-read through some parts of the Stripe documentation for clarity and to find what I was missing in my code.  1.5hrs of code. Then, I took my daughter to a birthday party, and went home to work on a project that wasn't my node app, just to break it up a little.  I'll get back to my node app in the morning.  

<strong>Thoughts**</strong> I have the main parts of my app done, I just have a few things to work out, and finish up with Stripe.  I have a lot to do for the app, but the MVP is nearly done.  So, I will implement the rest after I launch the main features that my client needs to get started. 
I plan to have it done by June 1st.  I hope.  
   
<h2>Day 12: May 28th 2018, Monday</h2>

<strong>Today's Progress:*</strong> Day12 #100daysofcode Aside from watching tutorials this morning, I learned that I can use GitBash IN VSCode's integrated terminal.  I was using it by itself.  Lol.  I spent 2 hours coding, but everyone is home...so hard to focus.  I didn't get too much done, but I learned a lot.  

<strong>Thoughts:*</strong> I need to back up a bit on my lessons, but not too much.  I looked into the MVC, and nodejs connections and then decided to go through all of the the NodeJS tutorials for beginners By theNewBoston on Youtube.  I have been finding little tidbits, but I need to go through all the basics again to ensure that I have it correct, bc I am missing something that I need to make this all fit together: so back to Nodejs basics. 

<h2>Day 13: May 29th 2018 Tuesday</h2>
<strong>Today's Progress:*</strong> Day13 #100daysofcode Learning more about #NodeJS, #Javascript #Stripe and more stuff related to tying my app together.  Spent a few hours coding on it.  Working on more before bed.  I learned how to do a markdown table in Github, today, too.  I bought a Udemy course on NodeJS and React, I am watching that this week.  I did 11 courses today. I hope to find the missing piece to tie my app together.  


<strong>Thoughts:*</strong>Still struggling, bc I skipped alot learning the fundamentals.  So, I am backtracking a little to fill in those gaps. Reviewing a lot of concepts to see where they fit in the best, and trying to make the app work as a whole.  

<h2>Day 14: May 30th 2018 Wednesday</h2>

<strong>Today's Progress:**</strong> More #NodeJS #JS #Stripe.  Remade a few of the elements that I was working on to see if there was a better way to get it done, but on the surface, it works the same.  

<strong>Thoughts:**</strong>I feel like Im taking too long, but I'm almost done.  I need to hurry up, though, so I can move on to the next project. 

<h2>Day 15: May 31, 2018 Thursday</h2>

<strong>Today's Progress:**</strong> *Started @udemy course #nodejs #fullstack @ste_grider #goodinfo #workflow 
*Learned how to set up some of the deployment on my VPS at Bluehost.
*Did 3 hours of code on #Stripe //still lots to do, but almostdone.  (I copied and pasted this from my Twitter, today bc I have a lot to do still.)

<strong>Thoughts:**</strong> I can feel the deployment getting closer, but still have testing to do. I also have a lot of stuff to do in Stripe on things that I am still learning about.  

<h2>Day 16: June 1, 2018 Friday</h2>

<strong>Today's Progress:**</strong> Day16 #100DaysOfCode More #nodejs project were today's focus.  Setup Git & did some admin stuff on my VPS, just to mentally break productively...lol.  More #stripe. ...still working on it.  

<strong>Thoughts</strong> Getting closer.  Seems so close, but so far.  I'm stilling learning as I go.  Sometimes I spend more time reading documentation and examples than I do actually coding.  Back to work after this post.  

<h2>Day 17: June 2, 2018</h2>
<strong>Today's Progress</strong> Play day for me today.  But, I got an hour of code in.  
<strong>Thoughts</strong> Date night.  Needed a mental break.

<h2>Day 18: June 3, 2018</h2>
<strong>Today's Progress</strong>  Lots of Docs: More #Stripe some #auth0 #passportjs still working on everything.  Mostly reading today, again.  But still made some progress. 
<strong>Thoughts</strong> Took a little break to take the girls skating with their friends.  Back to code before bed.
