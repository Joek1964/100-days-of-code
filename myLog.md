<h1>100 Days Of Code - Log</h1>
<h4>I am working on a project for a client and a few personal projects.  I will post my personal projects here, and any non-sensitive work here.
My current focus is web development.  I am getting familiar with the front end, and have a long way to go before I even master the fundamentals.
However, I am also learning some of the backend.  I have worked with html/css/javascript, which are the basics.  
I am  currently working on some PHP, mySQL and nodejs, and deciding which languages to use in which parts of my sites and web applications.
Seemingly, I can use php or nodejs for similar tasks.  The difference is that php is synchronous and node is asynchronous.  Each has its own benefits.  
NodeJS is mostly used in real-time applications, while PHP is used for more CPU-intense functions.  There is much more to these, but I may or may not cover them later in this log. 
It depends on my project and what I did that day.

<strong>Today's Progress:**</strong> I did a little bit of review in Freecodecamp.org (not much). I learned how to use github a little bit better. I looked up information about the NPM module "Forever" for node.js for a project that I am working on. I did some bracket notation and concatenation for javascript. I built the webmail access feature for a backend office tool that I am building for a client. I did about 4 hours of code study and one hour of actual code.

<strong>Thoughts:**</strong> Code study does not count as actual code. However, I have to look up information to actually get the code done. Does that count towards my coding time?

<Strong>Link to work:*</strong> The code for the project is private for a client. I will begin to add code here as a git-commit to a new repo. I will add that to my to do list for this challenge.
It is not all that eloborate or special, but I just need to protect it for now.  Still a newb, don't want to lose the security aspect of it.  I'll post a version of it later that does not include any credentials.  


<h2>Day 1: May 17, 2018: Thursday</h2>

<strong>Today's Progress:*</strong>  Here I learned a little bit about styling the markdown files here.  I will add more later today to this day 1 section.  


<strong>Thoughts:**</strong> How do I make a new file pretty here in GitHub?  Do I have to use HTML/CSS to make it pretty?  That is going to be what I find out later today.
