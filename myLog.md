<h1>100 Days Of Code - Log</h1>
<h4>I am working on a project for a client and a few personal projects.  I will post my personal projects here, and any non-sensitive work here.
My current focus is web development.  I am getting familiar with the front end, and have a long way to go before I even master the fundamentals.
However, I am also learning some of the backend.  I have worked with html/css/javascript, which are the basics.  
I am  currently working on some PHP, mySQL and nodejs, and deciding which languages to use in which parts of my sites and web applications.
Seemingly, I can use php or nodejs for similar tasks.  The difference is that php is synchronous and node is asynchronous.  Each has its own benefits.  
NodeJS is mostly used in real-time applications, while PHP is used for more CPU-intense functions.  There is much more to these, but I may or may not cover them later in this log. 
It depends on my project and what I did that day.

<strong>Today's Progress:**</strong> I did a little bit of review in Freecodecamp.org (not much). I learned how to use github a little bit better. I looked up information about the NPM module "Forever" for node.js for a project that I am working on. I did some bracket notation and concatenation for javascript. I built the webmail access feature for a backend office tool that I am building for a client. I did about 4 hours of code study and one hour of actual code.

<strong>Thoughts:**</strong> Code study does not count as actual code. However, I have to look up information to actually get the code done. Does that count towards my coding time?

<Strong>Link to work:*</strong> The code for the project is private for a client. I will begin to add code here as a git-commit to a new repo. I will add that to my to do list for this challenge.
It is not all that eloborate or special, but I just need to protect it for now.  Still a newb, don't want to lose the security aspect of it.  I'll post a version of it later that does not include any credentials.  


<h2>Day 1: May 17, 2018: Thursday</h2>

<strong>Today's Progress:*</strong>  Here I learned a little bit about styling the markdown files here.  I will add more later today to this day 1 section.  So, it's later...I did a lot of reading and a tutorial on NodeJS (which does not count towards my coding hour, but it was still part of my process for the day.  I have to build a project to work on for this challenge log so I have some code that I can show.  For my code, I did a NodeJS, mySQL connection for a client's web app/site.  I also worked on some of the front end features for the site.  


<strong>Thoughts:**</strong> How do I make a new file pretty here in GitHub?  Do I have to use HTML/CSS to make it pretty?  That is going to be what I find out later today.  

<Strong>Thoughts:**</strong>  I need to pick a project for GitHub for this 100daysofcode challenge, still.   

<strong>Link(s) to work:</strong> Just this and Twitter for now.  @Audrey_Lin_D  
So

<h2>Day 2: May 18, 2018: Friday</h2>

<strong>Today's progress:**</strong> I worked more on my NodeJS project for my coding hours.  But, I did a lot of other code related stuff that needed attention.  I linked my GitHubDesktop and GitHub files to WAMP.  I did a little bit of review on multidimensional arrays, and reviewed the .push and .pop functions in Javascript.  I set up a repo for learning algorithms.  I'll be working on that, along with "Cracking the Coding Interview", "Algorithms for Dummies", and some online resources. 

<strong>Thoughts:**</strong>I am trying to create a little more structure and organization to my learning path and web development schedules.  I feel like I am never going to learn it all...but I am making progress...and by the time I master NodeJS, there will probably be something else I need to learn instead, or in addition...but I think that might be the fun part of it. That, and a lot of legacy type languages, frameworks and libraries are still relevant for their respective purpose and project types.  It will just be part of my toolkit later, right?  ...Right.  Lol.


<h2>Day 3: May 19, 2018: Saturday</h2>
<strong>Today's Progress:**</strong>  Today, I went to a baby shower, so I did not get any real-code done. I did fit an hour in to catch up on Freecodecamp.  I was doing my study online with other resources, so my freecodecamp was looking a bit sad.  Also, I started further back than where I left off, bc I couldn't figure out something the last time, so I deleted my progress at a certain point, so I wanted to add it back into the progress bar.  Also, I constantly struggle with spacing syntax in the Freecodecamp's editor...of all things....lol.  I barely made my hour of code before midnight today, I forgot that weekend plans could get in the way of my code.  I usually code through the weekend around the kids and family stuff, but I am allowed a day or two break on my other project.  This challenge is to keep a 100 day streak, so I have to make sure I fit it in.==Noted.  But, I will have to plan it better next time. There's a lot of project/self management in coding...even when you are just learning by yourself.   

<strong>Thoughts:**</strong> So, I was looking for a project to do on Github for this challenge....and then I read the resources and found code ideas...lol.  So, that's good.  I will need that to add to my skill set display anyway, since I cannot display all of my other project in here.  And one of my other websites was a Muse/Dreamweaver project, but I didn't write much code on that one.  I just slapped it together with some stuff to get it out there for an MVP.  So, I am also working on coding that one properly.  Then, I had a third one that is in wordpress, but I plan on modifying the code for that in Wordpress with some PHP and Laravel when I finish this NodeJS project I have been working on.  I am moving way slower than I would like, but I have to make sure I have a functional app to release, and I keep breaking it in different places, bc I'm still nit picking information that I need instead of understanding all the code overall...so it is taking me way longer than it should.  But, I am working to make the fundamentals a priority this month, and then getting more into the advanced stuff in better detail.  Right now, I am huntin and peckin at it as I learn.  So, I have a little schedule, but sometimes I move backwards or spend a ton of time looking up information in random resources about nodejs in addition to the npm modules.  I am not familiar with a lot of things, even in some of the Javascript.  So, it is eating up my time.  I guess you can't learn things over night, but I sure wish I could learn faster.  Learning by doing is how I learn the fastest, though.  So, continuing on this little syllabus/schedule I have re-structured.  I'll spend a bit of time in each section for easier progress measurement.  

<h2>Day 4: May 20, 2018 Sunday</h2>
<strong>Today's Progress:**</strong> I did one hour of FreeCodeCamp for coding today. I passed where I left off before I went backward in the path to review, and I only have 34 more exercises before I get to the Object Oriented and Functional Programming section.  As far as other activities related to coding, I am looking into the resources.md file of this challenge. I discovered it yesterday.  I have been wondering what I need to do for a project, but I guess I should have read through all of the files sooner, lol.  I skimmed them all the first day, but didn't really pay attention to all of it.  Lol.  I was doing a lot of code related things today, but not actually coding.  I was working on my NodeJS project.  I was looking for some deployment information and learning about Stripe implementation.  I also came across a few good Medium articles and a GitHub repo about licensing.  I won't post the Medium articles here, but you can find a lot of really helpful articles on Medium.com for a variety of related topics.

   The Github Repo for the licensing, you can learn more about at https://choosealicense.com/ or https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com.  I don't really need this right now, but it is good to have for later.  There were also some other links for this https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-license-to-a-repository/ , and https://blog.github.com/2013-07-15-choosing-an-open-source-license/ . 
   
   Also, I came across Github Education.  I was curious.  (I've already graduated and do not qualify for the free account.  I'll probably sign up to it later.)  Anyway, I wanted to see what was included in the student developer pack, just to see what to look into. 
   This pack is to help "ship software like a pro".  The tools included in this pack include: 
   *ATOM (A customizable text editor) - This is a free text editor.  In my opinion, it is a powerful editor, and I like it.  However, I use Visual Studio Code for now.  
   *AWS educate: Access to the AWS cloud, free training & Collaboration resources.  
   *Bitnami: Gives you the business 3 plan free for the year. This helps you to install cloud apps easily.
   *Cart (data analysis tool)
   *CrowdFunder 
   *DataDog
   *Digital Ocean (I hear lots of great things about Digital Ocean.)
   *Flatiron School
   *GitHub
   *GitKraken
   *Hackhands
   *Microsoft Imagine
   *NameCheap (Domain name & SSL cert free for a year)
   *SendGrid (Email Infrastructure as a Service)
   *Sentry (Polygot error tracker, framework, & library.
   *Stripe
   *Taplytics (Dynamic a/b testing)
   *Thinkful (WebDev lessons)
   *tansifex : localization access
   *Travis CI : Continuous Integration
   *Unreal Engine: Game Dev tools for multiplatforms
   
   All of these are included in the student pack.  I just wanted to see what was being used.  I am aware of some, but not all of these.  I want to look more into them as I need them.  I am working on implementing Stripe into my current NodeJS project for my client.  
   
   <strong>Thoughts: **</strong> I spend a lot of time on distractions, but mostly ones that are related to development.  However, I have implemented the pomodoro timer, so if I want to look more into something that I find while I am supposed to be coding, I'll just bookmark it and come back to it, unless it is directly related to my code session.  Learning focus is probably a huge factor to getting anything right or done in code, for sure.  I know there are focus extensions to keep you from browsing away from your task, but I am not necessarily going to other random sites, bc I wasn't coding, but I leave my code to find more information to better or fix it. So, I am adding that to my list of things to work on. 
   
  <h2>Day 5: May 21, 2018 Monday</h2>
  
  <strong>Today's Progress</strong> Day 5: Worked 5 hours on my node app today.  Lots of search/reading/trial/error: still poundin' away at it.  Today at lunch, I took a break to work on my site, but went back to my node app after a half hour.  After dinner: looked into #AngularJS, then my app again.
  
  <strong>Thoughts: </strong> Need to get done.  
  
  <h2>Day 6: May 22, 2018 Tuesday</h2>
  <strong>Today's Progress</strong>  I was not at my laptop today for most of today.  But, I studied different types of #functions #Javascript on my phone.  When I got home, I worked on @freeCodeCamp & my node app.  I also reviewed code on Github for reference and examples of #node #stripe.  
  
  <strong>Thoughts**</strong>I want to get done with FreeCodeCamp's basic JavaScript section already.  I think I am going to set my goal to be at 216 (starting ObjectOriented and Functional Programming) in the tutorials by Sunday night.  I have been doing only a couple of problems at a time, but only because I went looking for more resources, online, for those topics.  So, I was working on them, and working to understand them more clearly for myself, not just to get them done.  I think that is the only way it will stick for me...that and reusing that concept in my code frequently.
