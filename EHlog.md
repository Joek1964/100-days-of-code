# 100 Days Of Code - Ellen's Log

### DAY -2: August 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Launched my website today!

**Thoughts:** The purpose of this website is to chart my journey through concrete steps, one project at a time. The website is hosted through Github Pages and the domain came from hover.

### DAY 1: August 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made progress on CSS for Project 2 - Top National Parks, specifically the header, footer and table attributes. Also read a few articles about using responsive design effectively.

**Thoughts**: Learning more about CSS - though I wanted to start jumping into more complicated CSS topics today I held myself back to focus on tables/headers/footers. It was a good idea because as it turns out, there is plenty of complication in these topics! :)

**Link(s) to work**: Coming Soon
