# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2017

**Today's Progress:** 

Today I start with the challenge, and set things up. 

So I downloaded Smartgit (http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/download) because I am using Linux Mint and I wanted a GUI git. And this works for me. 

I use Brackets as Code editor (http://brackets.io), with a lot of plugins. 

My main project is to make a personal website. So besides Github, I'm actually gonna upload a website to http://mathegrievink.ml.
So you can track my progress there if you want.

So not a lot of code yet. But I'm very exciting.

**Time working:**
I think 3 or 4 hours? I was working and looking #open2017.

**Thoughts:** 

Happy New Year!!!
So today I start with the #100DaysOfCode challenge.
One of my goals for this challenge is making a personal website with all my projects and other things on it. 

I'm only a bit familiar with HTML/CSS so I want to learn Javascript and other things so I can create better websites in 2017. 

My English is not very good, because I live in The Netherlands. (Feel free to reply spelling or grammer mistakes :D.)

### Day 2: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress:**
Starting with basics of my website project. I'm using http://000webhost.com for hosting, and linked as an FTP Server to my computer. I think I can start with code tomorrow (finally).

**Time working:**
1 hour

**Thoughts:**
Need to learn things again because I haven't did it a while. Like how to use an external css stylesheet. I looked to my FreeCodeCamp map, I am working on JavaScript, but I'm going to do a lot of things again. Because I don't know it anymore.

### Day 3: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:**
Started with the Build a personal portfolio webpage project on FCC. (which I hope can finish tomorrow) Did a part of the Responsive Design with Bootstrap again. Search some sites for designs, I found http://coolers.co. Which is fantastic! I use http://hackerthemes.com/bootstrap-cheatsheet as cheatsheet. 

**Time working:**
2 - 3 hours

**Thoughts:**
I had 2 coding sessions, one in the afternoon and one in the evening. When I wanted to start with the Build a personal portfolio project, I found a file from August. It looked terrible. So I deleted things so I can start again. My afternoon session was a bit searching for old resources/tutorials, my evening session was making the portfolio webpage and was very productive.
