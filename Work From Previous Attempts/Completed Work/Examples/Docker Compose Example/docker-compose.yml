# This Compose file defines two services: web and redis.

# The web service uses an image thatâ€™s built from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
# It then binds the container and the host machine to the exposed port, 5000. 
# This example service uses the default port for the Flask web server, 5000.


# The redis service uses a public Redis image pulled from the Docker Hub registry.

# The new volumes key mounts the project directory (current directory) on the host to /code inside the container,
#  allowing you to modify the code on the fly, without having to rebuild the image.
#   The environment key sets the FLASK_ENV environment variable, which tells flask run to run 
#   in development mode and reload the code on change.
#  This mode should only be used in development.
