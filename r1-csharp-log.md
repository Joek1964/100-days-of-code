**Log**

**R1D1 - December 12th, 2018**
Finished setting up the Visual Studio Code for C# development. I am running two challenges now, but I took to learning as much C# as I can because I have an upcoming interview for a developer position in that language. Wish me luck.

**R1D2 - December 13th, 2018**
Finished the introductory part of the C# Foundamentals course on Pluralsight
