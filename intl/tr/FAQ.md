## FAQ:

**S:** Bu meydan okumayı yapan başka insanlarla nasıl iletişime geçebilirim?
**C:** Bağlanmanın en iyi yolu, resmi 100DaysOfCode sitesinde bulunan kaynakların listesini kullanmaktır:
www.100DaysOfCode.com/connect
Aynı zamanda burada, [Slack 100DaysOfCode kanalına davetiye](https://www.100daysofcode.com/slack).

Twitter'da #100DaysOfCode'u ara veya [the 100DaysOfCode room on Gitter](https://gitter.im/Kallaway/100DaysOfCode) userinden katil - davetiyeye ihtiyacin yok, herkese acik. Ayni zamanda Komunite ile baglantida kalmak icin bu adresi takip et [@\_100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/_100DaysOfCode).

**S:** Yarışmaya zaten başladım ve şu anda 8. Gündeyim. İlerlememi takip etmek için bu depoyu kullanmaya nasıl başlayabilirim?
**A:** Merak etmeyin. Önceki günlere ait bilgileri yukleyebildiginiz kadar yuklemeye calisin, ancak yapamazsanız, şu andaki ilerlemenizden devam edin. Her gün ilerlemeniz hakkında tweet atıyorsanız, tweet'lerinizin bağlantılarını her gün için günlüğe ekleyin. Sonraki gunler icin bu formati takip edin.

**S:** Kodlamada yeniyim (veya sadece kodlamayı öğrenmeye karar veriyorum) ve henüz proje oluşturamıyorum, ne yapmalıyım?
**C:** Başlamanın en iyi yolu, [FreeCodeCamp’ın Ön Uç Müfredatını] (https://www.freecodecamp.com/) en başından takip etmektir. 100 gün boyunca ne kadar uzağa giderseniz o kadar iyidir.

**Q:** I’ve missed a day, does it mean I’ve failed the challenge?
**A:** Absolutely not. You are allowed to miss one day (then make it up by adding one more day to the end of the 100), but never miss two days in a row. This is a great piece of advice on habit formation that I got from Leo Babauta at zen habits.

**Q:** Eve gec geldim, kod yazmayi bitirdigimde, saat 12'yi gecti. Sayilirmi?
**A:** Of course it counts! The rule of thumb is: have you coded for at least an hour before going to sleep that day? If yes, you are on track.
The reason for this is that we all have different schedules and different life periods (kids, school, work, and what have you) so don’t hold yourself to some arbitrary time standard. You will not experience what Cinderella experienced once the clock strikes midnight.
Don't worry whether you get a point on GitHub on that particular day. Yes, it’s nice to have them in a streak one by one, but don’t do yourself a disservice by measuring your efforts to a clock.

**Q:** Should I keep a journal?
**A:** Yes you should, and the best way to do that is to fork this repo, and commit to [the Log](log.md) daily. It’s helpful in two major ways: you will be able to look at the progress each day and see how far you’ve already come and it will be easier to find the motivation to continue, and the second one is that after you’ve done your 100 days, you will be able to analyze your experience better and see what worked and what didn’t.

**Q:** Should I put my projects online?
**A:** Definitely. It’s great for accountability and motivation to know that the stuff you’ve worked on is accessible online to anyone who may wish to look at it. It will make you care about the end product more, and will lead to a more impressive result in the end. I suggest you put them on GitHub.

**Q:** Should I worry about streaks?
**A:** Streaks are nice and helpful, but as I mentioned above — don’t worry about them too much and don’t criticize yourself over missing a day. Instead, make sure you do everything to not let that happen again, and know that worrying and scolding yourself will not give you any results. (Ok, It will give you results, but only negative. I would call them consequences, not results) The best way to get out of that negative emotional state is to sit down and code.

**Q:** What is the most difficult part of this challenge?
**A:** The part where you have to sit down and start coding. Don’t postpone that or think about it at all, because you will rationalize yourself out of it. Approach it mechanically: sit down, open your laptop, launch your coding editor, and start typing. After 5 minutes, you will not feel any problems/procrastination/desire to stop.

**Q:** If everyone started on a certain day, should I join them on the day they are? For example, from Day 12?
**A:** This challenge is individual, so when you join you start at day 1. Whenever you’ll be posting an update on Twitter or elsewhere, make sure to mention which day you are on and use the hashtag so that people can find and support you!
