DAY 4: FEBRUARY 17 , 2019 

Today's Progress: Got more comfortable with methods, objects and using 'this'. Also learned about booleans which can either be set to true or false.

Thoughts: I really like this professor and have cleared up some gaps in my knowledge.

DAY 5: FEBRUARY 18 , 2019 

Today's Progress: Learned about the  ! bang property. It basically takes a boolean value and gets its opposite. This is helpful when we want to toggle something in JS. we also went over for loops. i was previously familair with for loops so most of this was review. He cleared up some loops in my knowledge like when to when we use i inside the function it will be the current item we are on in the loop. Kind of confusiong but working through it. 

Thoughts: For loops arfe kind of confusing but working through it.
