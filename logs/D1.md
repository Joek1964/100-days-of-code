**Today's Progress**:  
PHP basic routing and the beginnings of user authentication

**Thoughts:**  
  I managed my hour, today was halloween and my girl had a day off, so we spent a lot of time just chilling together and visiting friends.

**Personal Reflections**
  I don't do well without a team.  
  I can't become part of a team without proving I do well.  
  The teams I have ended up with are _invariably_ comprised of humans. With which I don't get on.  
  That... is the real world problem I need solved.  
  Given the pieces under my control, step two, is simply to learn to do well on my own.  
  That is one of the things this challenge looks to help with.
