Day 31
Nov 21, 2018

Today's Progress: figured out how to refactor my code into functional programming structure.  Developed a standard way to test for key/value pairs in the data so the code won't crash if the JSON data is not well formed.  Got the data structure working in client-side Javascript so that I can use the Chrome debugger environment.  Wrote new pseudocode for the entire to-be data filter, including looping over multiple input data sets, filtering out uninteresting records, and storing relevant text for interesting records.  Made coding tweaks to improve current (working) version for a single file.

Thoughts: If I get in the right head space and can really focus, uninterrupted, for an hour or so, I can make amazing progress.  Then I have to take a break, decompress, think about other things.  During that time, other ideas/implications of what I've accomplished kind of fall out of my head.  After a certain amount of decompression, I can go back and do another round.  The challenge is to get into the mindset, and to find an hour without interruption.

Day 30
Nov 20, 2018

Today's Progress: Coded up the logic for creating a year's worth of file names and looping to read, sort, and write them.  Also made progress on further filtering my data, creating topic models, and reading and writing JSON files.  Perhaps most importantly, I thought hard about how to structure and parse my data for training the topic models.

Thoughts: With the advancement in filtering I discovered by studying my data set, I think I can get to a very good corpus without much manual sorting of data records. That's great because it means I can spend my time learning to train topic models (e.g. getting the code working, creating a test model), and then running various test corpus datasets through the models to use AI to score and filter deal content.  I'm not there yet, but I can see the core AI stuff on the horizon.

Day 26, 27, 28, 29
Nov 19, 2018

Today's Progress: Finished filtering data, downloaded a year's worth of data, started coding to read in, filter, and parse by deal stage to create training data sets for models.

Thoughts: I'm not going to blame myself for not getting more coding done since Nov 8.  I had a lot of stuff going on, and Agile work is just as important to learn and practice.  But man, it felt good to make such great progress today and I can't help thinking how much farther along I'd have been if I'd been able to do more coding.  No matter, by the end of this week I'm sure I'll have my environment set up and have made a lot more progress.  Maybe even into model training.

Day 25
Nov 15, 2018

Today's Progress: Not much.  Family crises large and small kept me from getting much done.  I looked at GitKraken and am about to take a look at a Jupyter tutorial.

Thoughts: There are just so many things going on lately I can't keep up with them.  I'm not getting much work done. I hope I can get back to normal and get some coding done soon.  Fortunately, next week is Thanksgiving and I'm taking the week off.

Day 20, 21, 22, 23, 24
Nov 14, 2018

Today's Progress: Rebuilt my swim lane chart as an Agile circle.  Swim lanes are automation and human activities for now.  I can slice more precisely as I move forward.  Also rebuilt my Kanban board to align with the cyclical Agile construct.  It already feels so much more intuitive to create checklists in the Kanban tasks.  All of the user stories make sense.  So I think it's a big improvement.

Thoughts: Learning and executing Agile is one of my goals for this challenge.  So spending several days on this is useful.  I recognize I'm not coding on those days, but this is important too.  If I'm creating a platform, it has to have several components that I'm not working on at any given time.  Javascript, Node, Python, Jupyter, Mural, Trello, Slack.  It's true that I'm not coding, but Swim Lanes and Agile are important, and I had no concrete way of expressing my platform goals until I took this on.  It's worth it - as long as I get back to coding now that I'm done updating my Agile docs.  It doesn't help that I'm on my own while Maggie's in LA.

Day 19
Nov 9, 2018

Today's Progress: Didn't do any coding, but i spent extensive time analyzing my input data.  Came up with several coding activities I need to do to further cleanse my source data.  I also got much further on understanding topic modeling, and changed my entire approach. I realize my prior approach had been way off, but it was a great lesson.

Thoughts: I have a much deeper understanding now of how to do the AI modeling that I'm trying to accomplish.  As a result of that understanding, I hvae a lot more data prep to do, but I'm excited to do it.

Day 18
Nov 8, 2018

Today's Progress: I got my JSON filter code working.  It's not functional programming (I used procedural) and it onluy works on one day's data (I have to figure out how to append to files, unless I can merge in Power BI or something).  But I can officially read the JSON output from the parser, filter on NAICS codes, and write out a file of the interesting deals.

Thoughts: Of the 1225 updates to the FedBizOpps website on Nov 5, 127 were potentially relevant.  Which means theremay be a lot of relevant deals out there, and if I can build some good AI, it could be very valuable in finding the best ones to pursue.  I'm sure some will score low and I'll narrow it down, but very encouraging that it may be a problem set that is big enough to not just work manually, but small enough to be manageable as a proof of concept.  This is very exciting.

Day 17
Nov 7, 2018

Today's Progress: Ran my first node.js program (hello world) and second - the FBO parser from 18F. Made some additions to the code to parse the data.  Still struggling with object references in Javascript.  But I learned how to debug in node.  Also validated my JSON files and examined them.  Started the data schema design for my project.

Thoughts: Made great progress today.  Frustrating that I couldn't figure out how to reference the object name/value pairs, but I know I'll get there.  Made progress on debugging node, but the debugger seems a bit weak.  Glad I persevered and made good progress despite some fits and starts.

Day 16
Nov 6, 2018

Today's Progress: Did a lot of configuration of my (too weak) Windows VM to try to get my dataset working in Power BI.  Set up Visual Studio IDE, FTP, and did some test input of an XML file into Power BI.  Unfortunately, I can't get my 1.2 million line dataset to load properly.

Thoughts: My options are to keep trying using the current dataset, which is a problem because neither Power BI nor Atom seems to recognize it as an XML file, so there must be errors in it.  Second option is to write a parser in Javascript, which seems reasonable but will take me at least a week (though it will build some critical coding skills).  Third option is to learn Node.js well enough to parse the daily files using the parser that the 18F guys wrote.  I'm kind of pursuing all three now, but with a focus on importing into Power BI.  I may need to go to one of the other options soon.  If it's not good xml, it's probably going to be difficult to use over time.

Day 15
Nov 5, 2018

Today's Progress: Got my Windows VM working in Azure.  Got Power BI installed. Did more research on data sources and processes for data ingest, picked a data ingest path.  Reviewed the data fields and some peripheral tools to ingest file attachments to deals.  Tried ingesting my XML data but failed.  Diagnostics and discussion with a cloud architect friend suggests I need a beefier VM.  Going to Webex with him tomorrow to learn to save snapshots of my environment and then provision a bigger VM. 

Thoughts: Had a real breakthrough today.  I had tried a couple of times to set up my Windows environment and couldn't get it working.  It was a good demonstration of the concept that if I really lean into the problem, I know I can solve it.  I shouldn't be so tentative, especially after an initial setback.

Day 14
Nov 4, 2018

Today's Progress: Reviewed my Kanban and swim lane chart, decided to dig into FedBizOpps data feeds.  Found a weekly data feed, though it seems to be all the records updated for the week, rather than the full database.  There's an API as well, but it looks complicated to use.

Thoughts: I need to spend some time on Power BI, XML editing, data filtering, data prep, and building a full data, including historical data, for relevant deals.  I'm assuming that if I filter, there won't be too many deal records to handle.  I'll also need to get my Windows VM working in Azure so I can run Power BI.

Day 10, 11, 12, 13
Nov 3, 2018

Today's Progress: Agile: Built a Kanban board with all of the tasks from my swim lane chart.  Added a user story to each one.  The user stories are first drafts (MVPs), I'll refine them as I go if needed.  But now I have a really great plan to execute.

Thoughts: Oct 31: Identified four skills that I need to develop as part of this project.  Agile to improve management skills, Communication/presentation to sell the idea at my company and in the AI/ML community, AI/ML methods and tools to learn about Government and deal data, and Javascript and Python to implement the system.  November 1: Drafted my swim lane chart, reviewed against Agile guidelines from the course I took.  November 2: Transcribed my notes from the swim lane pencil sketch to a Mural.  Used a template that turned out to be perfect.  Spent several hours building the diagram to show process flows, data flows, and stages of value in the process.  Color coded by role in the swim lanes.  November 3: Translated the Mural components into a Trello Kanban chart.  Expanded each box of the Mural/Trello task name, including a user story for each one, and labeling using the same color scheme as the Mural so that I can track progress of each stream.

Day 09
Oct 30, 2018

Today's Progress: Came up with the idea of two tracks.  One is the coding (bottom up) track, the other is Agile representation of requirements (top down) track.  Separate task set for each.  I will only count the bottom-up track as part of the 100Days of code, but the top down gives me permission to spend two hours a day doing this project work.  And the Agile part is a less technical, but still useful and marketable, skill that I can use to create my presentation layer.  I also killed my VM (I have learned enough to start over and do it right).  And I researched topic models and how they're built.

Thoughts: Good progress.  I'm not actually prepping data or coding, which is bothering me.  But I'm learning really important stuff.  I will get there.  I need to trust the path I'm on for the next few days.  I know I'll be coding soon.

Day 06, 07, 08
Oct 27, 28, 29, 2018

Today's Progress: Decided to move forward with provisioning a Windows VM on Azure to run Power BI.  Took a couple of hours over a few days to get it provisioned.  I still haven't gotten remote access to it.  But I'm close.  I think I just need to provision a new one and kill the one I have.  I'm going to use Windows Server and see if Power BI will run on it.  I've also done some tutorials on Power BI (continued), Azure, and provisioning VMs (youtube).  

Thoughts: I've certainly spent at least an hour a day on this stuff, but it's been going a bit slow because I'm not doing a course curriculum where the material is all laid out for me, like FreeCodeCamp or Fast.AI.  This is harder but it's part of the process of trying to tie my training into useful work.  Overall, even though the past few days have been frustrating, I've learned a lot and shown some resilience to solve my problems outside of a standard curriculum. I feel like the skills I've built are much more aligned with a professional using tools to solve problems than a student.  I hope I can maintain this real-world goal/learn-as-I-go approach.

Day 05
Oct 26, 2018

Today's Progress: Thought through the value proposition to justify the investment for doing my project.  Drafted a business requirements document that defines strategic objectives and several potential avenues to start achieving those objectives.

Thoughts: I spent a lot of time thinking through how my approach really adds value, and what steps I need to take to make sure I achieve some value in my day job with the work I'm doing on AI.  I think the tactical discoveries I make in the data will change my direction at a detail level, but my overall direction and value proposition won't change.  However, I have to get more serious now about learning the requisite skills. I've had a very productive few days of conceptual and strategic work, but it will mean nothing if I don't learn to code well enough to execute the plan.

Day 04
Oct 25, 2018

Today's Progress: Spent time researching BI tools, landed on using Power BI from Microsoft.  Looks like it can do small datasets pretty well, which is what I'm looking to do.

Thoughts: I have to really get into the notion of learning some serious data visualization.  I have some good ideas for how to integrate AI/ML into my project.  But first I need to be able to prep the data, and there's a learning curve for that.  It will be immediately useful.  I read an article recently (in Harvard Business Review?) that said data visualization is a good place to start.  So far I agree.  I feel like I'm making good progress, learning new things while building on what I already know.

Day 03
Oct 24, 2018

Today's Progress: Met with Clark to discuss areas of focus for my AI work around Federal sales.  Came up with some great ideas around topic modeling and using FedBizOpps to develop data sets for evaluating deals.  I did some follow-up research on how to get at the data I care about (API), data visualization, and researched some tools to create topic models.

Thoughts: One meeting with someone who knows what they're doing and I got a ton out of it.  Really great stuff.  I'll have to figure out how to keep going with Clark without asking too much of him.  But it's clear that this AI stuff needs a data scientist and a SME. I'm a SME (on Federal deals) and I can learn to be a Data Scientist.  Coding also required, which I am, or will be when I brush up on some skills.

Day 02
Oct 23, 2018

Today's Progress: Spent more time working through a Python course.  Got less out of it today than yesterday, but still good expereince getting re-acclimated to programming and learned a few things about Pyton syntax.  

Thoughts: Will wrap up tomorrow and move on to Panda, NumPy, and then Jupyter.  I have to keep reminding myself not to try to take on too much. If I'm going at the right pace, my ego says I should go much faster.  But if I go too fast, I get ahead of myself and get frustrated.  Better to feel like I'm going a little too slow but making progress.  I feel like I'd make more progress by going faster, but I'd just get frustrated and stop.  I know this from experience.

Day 01
Oct 22, 2018

Today's Progress: Set up Round 3 of #100_days_of_code in Github, identified Python Coursework to start challenge and created a playlist in Safari Media, reached out to a colleague working on AI to see if we can work together.

Thoughts: I'm looking forward to this. Round 1 was a great success. Round 2 lasted 23 days.  So I have a dose of hard R2 reality to temper my R1 enthusiasm.  Bill Gates is quoted as saying “Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years.”  I have to remember that.  I tend to overestimate what I can accomplish in one hour, and I've definitely underestimated what I've accomplished with coding in the last year.  If I stick with it, I can use my coding to contribute to society.  But I need to build a critical mass of skills first.
