Day 03
Oct 24, 2018

Today's Progress: Met with Clark to discuss areas of focus for my AI work around Federal sales.  Came up with some great ideas around topic modeling and using FedBizOpps to develop data sets for evaluating deals.  I did some follow-up research on how to get at the data I care about (API), data visualization, and researched some tools to create topic models.

Thoughts: One meeting with someone who knows what they're doing and I got a ton out of it.  Really great stuff.  I'll have to figure out how to keep going with Clark without asking too much of him.  But it's clear that this AI stuff needs a data scientist and a SME. I'm a SME (on Federal deals) and I can learn to be a Data Scientist.  Coding also required, which I am, or will be when I brush up on some skills.

Day 02

Today's Progress: Spent more time working through a Python course.  Got less out of it today than yesterday, but still good expereince getting re-acclimated to programming and learned a few things about Pyton syntax.  

Thoughts: Will wrap up tomorrow and move on to Panda, NumPy, and then Jupyter.  I have to keep reminding myself not to try to take on too much. If I'm going at the right pace, my ego says I should go much faster.  But if I go too fast, I get ahead of myself and get frustrated.  Better to feel like I'm going a little too slow but making progress.  I feel like I'd make more progress by going faster, but I'd just get frustrated and stop.  I know this from experience.

Day 01
Oct 22, 2018

Today's Progress: Set up Round 3 of #100_days_of_code in Github, identified Python Coursework to start challenge and created a playlist in Safari Media, reached out to a colleague working on AI to see if we can work together.

Thoughts: I'm looking forward to this. Round 1 was a great success. Round 2 lasted 23 days.  So I have a dose of hard R2 reality to temper my R1 enthusiasm.  Bill Gates is quoted as saying “Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years.”  I have to remember that.  I tend to overestimate what I can accomplish in one hour, and I've definitely underestimated what I've accomplished with coding in the last year.  If I stick with it, I can use my coding to contribute to society.  But I need to build a critical mass of skills first.
