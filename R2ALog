Day 15
Nov 5, 2018

Today's Progress: Got my Windows VM working in Azure.  Got Power BI installed. Did more research on data sources and processes for data ingest, picked a data ingest path.  Reviewed the data fields and some peripheral tools to ingest file attachments to deals.  Tried ingesting my XML data but failed.  Diagnostics and discussion with a cloud architect friend suggests I need a beefier VM.  Going to Webex with him tomorrow to learn to save snapshots of my environment and then provision a bigger VM. 

Thoughts: Had a real breakthrough today.  I had tried a couple of times to set up my Windows environment and couldn't get it working.  It was a good demonstration of the concept that if I really lean into the problem, I know I can solve it.  I shouldn't be so tentative, especially after an initial setback.

Day 14
Nov 4, 2018

Today's Progress: Reviewed my Kanban and swim lane chart, decided to dig into FedBizOpps data feeds.  Found a weekly data feed, though it seems to be all the records updated for the week, rather than the full database.  There's an API as well, but it looks complicated to use.

Thoughts: I need to spend some time on Power BI, XML editing, data filtering, data prep, and building a full data, including historical data, for relevant deals.  I'm assuming that if I filter, there won't be too many deal records to handle.  I'll also need to get my Windows VM working in Azure so I can run Power BI.

Today's Progress: Agile: Built a Kanban board with all of the tasks from my swim lane chart.  Added a user story to each one.  The user stories are first drafts (MVPs), I'll refine them as I go if needed.  But now I have a really great plan to execute.

Thoughts: Oct 31: Identified four skills that I need to develop as part of this project.  Agile to improve management skills, Communication/presentation to sell the idea at my company and in the AI/ML community, AI/ML methods and tools to learn about Government and deal data, and Javascript and Python to implement the system.  November 1: Drafted my swim lane chart, reviewed against Agile guidelines from the course I took.  November 2: Transcribed my notes from the swim lane pencil sketch to a Mural.  Used a template that turned out to be perfect.  Spent several hours building the diagram to show process flows, data flows, and stages of value in the process.  Color coded by role in the swim lanes.  November 3: Translated the Mural components into a Trello Kanban chart.  Expanded each box of the Mural/Trello task name, including a user story for each one, and labeling using the same color scheme as the Mural so that I can track progress of each stream.

Day 09
Oct 30, 2018

Today's Progress: Came up with the idea of two tracks.  One is the coding (bottom up) track, the other is Agile representation of requirements (top down) track.  Separate task set for each.  I will only count the bottom-up track as part of the 100Days of code, but the top down gives me permission to spend two hours a day doing this project work.  And the Agile part is a less technical, but still useful and marketable, skill that I can use to create my presentation layer.  I also killed my VM (I have learned enough to start over and do it right).  And I researched topic models and how they're built.

Thoughts: Good progress.  I'm not actually prepping data or coding, which is bothering me.  But I'm learning really important stuff.  I will get there.  I need to trust the path I'm on for the next few days.  I know I'll be coding soon.

Oct 27, 28, 29, 2018

Today's Progress: Decided to move forward with provisioning a Windows VM on Azure to run Power BI.  Took a couple of hours over a few days to get it provisioned.  I still haven't gotten remote access to it.  But I'm close.  I think I just need to provision a new one and kill the one I have.  I'm going to use Windows Server and see if Power BI will run on it.  I've also done some tutorials on Power BI (continued), Azure, and provisioning VMs (youtube).  

Thoughts: I've certainly spent at least an hour a day on this stuff, but it's been going a bit slow because I'm not doing a course curriculum where the material is all laid out for me, like FreeCodeCamp or Fast.AI.  This is harder but it's part of the process of trying to tie my training into useful work.  Overall, even though the past few days have been frustrating, I've learned a lot and shown some resilience to solve my problems outside of a standard curriculum. I feel like the skills I've built are much more aligned with a professional using tools to solve problems than a student.  I hope I can maintain this real-world goal/learn-as-I-go approach.

Day 05
Oct 26, 2018

Today's Progress: Thought through the value proposition to justify the investment for doing my project.  Drafted a business requirements document that defines strategic objectives and several potential avenues to start achieving those objectives.

Thoughts: I spent a lot of time thinking through how my approach really adds value, and what steps I need to take to make sure I achieve some value in my day job with the work I'm doing on AI.  I think the tactical discoveries I make in the data will change my direction at a detail level, but my overall direction and value proposition won't change.  However, I have to get more serious now about learning the requisite skills. I've had a very productive few days of conceptual and strategic work, but it will mean nothing if I don't learn to code well enough to execute the plan.

Day 04
Oct 25, 2018

Today's Progress: Spent time researching BI tools, landed on using Power BI from Microsoft.  Looks like it can do small datasets pretty well, which is what I'm looking to do.

Thoughts: I have to really get into the notion of learning some serious data visualization.  I have some good ideas for how to integrate AI/ML into my project.  But first I need to be able to prep the data, and there's a learning curve for that.  It will be immediately useful.  I read an article recently (in Harvard Business Review?) that said data visualization is a good place to start.  So far I agree.  I feel like I'm making good progress, learning new things while building on what I already know.

Day 03
Oct 24, 2018

Today's Progress: Met with Clark to discuss areas of focus for my AI work around Federal sales.  Came up with some great ideas around topic modeling and using FedBizOpps to develop data sets for evaluating deals.  I did some follow-up research on how to get at the data I care about (API), data visualization, and researched some tools to create topic models.

Thoughts: One meeting with someone who knows what they're doing and I got a ton out of it.  Really great stuff.  I'll have to figure out how to keep going with Clark without asking too much of him.  But it's clear that this AI stuff needs a data scientist and a SME. I'm a SME (on Federal deals) and I can learn to be a Data Scientist.  Coding also required, which I am, or will be when I brush up on some skills.

Day 02
Oct 23, 2018

Today's Progress: Spent more time working through a Python course.  Got less out of it today than yesterday, but still good expereince getting re-acclimated to programming and learned a few things about Pyton syntax.  

Thoughts: Will wrap up tomorrow and move on to Panda, NumPy, and then Jupyter.  I have to keep reminding myself not to try to take on too much. If I'm going at the right pace, my ego says I should go much faster.  But if I go too fast, I get ahead of myself and get frustrated.  Better to feel like I'm going a little too slow but making progress.  I feel like I'd make more progress by going faster, but I'd just get frustrated and stop.  I know this from experience.

Day 01
Oct 22, 2018

Today's Progress: Set up Round 3 of #100_days_of_code in Github, identified Python Coursework to start challenge and created a playlist in Safari Media, reached out to a colleague working on AI to see if we can work together.

Thoughts: I'm looking forward to this. Round 1 was a great success. Round 2 lasted 23 days.  So I have a dose of hard R2 reality to temper my R1 enthusiasm.  Bill Gates is quoted as saying “Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years.”  I have to remember that.  I tend to overestimate what I can accomplish in one hour, and I've definitely underestimated what I've accomplished with coding in the last year.  If I stick with it, I can use my coding to contribute to society.  But I need to build a critical mass of skills first.
