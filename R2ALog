Day 01
Oct 22, 2018

Today's Progress: Set up Round 3 of #100_days_of_code in Github, identified Python Coursework to start challenge and created a playlist in Safari Media, reached out to a colleague working on AI to see if we can work together.

Thoughts: I'm looking forward to this. Round 1 was a great success. Round 2 lasted 23 days.  So I have a dose of hard R2 reality to temper my R1 enthusiasm.  Bill Gates is quoted as saying “Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years.”  I have to remember that.  I tend to overestimate what I can accomplish in one hour, and I've definitely underestimated what I've accomplished with coding in the last year.  If I stick with it, I can use my coding to contribute to society.  But I need to build a critical mass of skills first.
