# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Anubis Lockward

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [June 24, Sunday, 2018].

## Log

### R1D1 - June 24th, 2018
Completed four Pomodoros of work on the Baby Names Project for the Coursera specialization, it felt great. https://github.com/mr2much/CourseraSpecialization.git

### R1D2 - June 25th, 2018
Worked on the Baby Names Project for one hour, implemented tests cases for getting a name of the same rank than another given name, and another test case for getting the year in which a given name had the highest rank. Still thinking of implementing a UI to this thing. How would I apply Agile to this project if it is already ongoing?

### R1D3 - June 26th, 2018
Woke up late, only worked for 30 minutes on the Baby Names Project. Implemented a method for getting the average rank of a name in a given range of years. Learned how to round decimal numbers using BigDecimal as suggested by an answer provided by user593581 on a Stack Overflow question, here's the link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/153724/how-to-round-a-number-to-n-decimal-places-in-java

### R1D4 - June 27th, 2018
Woke up way too late today, so I didn't code at my usual hour which is 5:30 AM, will try to code later in the day. Last night I installed Tomcat, Maven and Eclipse for Java EE, and started learning about deploying web apps to deploy the Baby Names Project to the web.

Finally worked on implementing the last test case of the Baby Names Project. Didn't take too long. Now I've got to start working on implementing the project as a web application. Or maybe I should start working on finishing the first module on Coursera, and then working on the project. We'll see.

### R1D5 - June 28th, 2018
Felt a little bit drowzy when I woke up this morning. Coded anyways, changed a bunch of stuff, since the file loading for the class ListByYear. Implemented helper method to extract the year from the filename; also, implemented a method to load a file list by passing it a filename. Also implemented a method for loading a range of files by using a DirectoryResource. Finallly, implemented the last test case and changed previous tests to use the new methods, nothing broke. Going to start working with real implementation of code tomorrow.

### R1D6 - June 30th, 2018

Didn't code at all yesterday. But today coded for like 2 hours, completed at least Pomodoros of work without counting extra time invested without calculating it. Fixed a few implementation issues with getting the total girls, total boys and total overall, since I didn't count the total names but the size of the ArrayList, then had to implement again a code that did just that for one of the test cases. Finished the end of module Quizz for the first module of the Coursera Java Specialization, and now I'm thinking about implementing the Extend Your Program suggestions and the optional Honors Content before moving on to course 2.

### R1D7 - July 2nd, 2018

Didn't code yesterday because I had a family day, and coded only a little bit today because it was my wife's birthday. Anyways, starting working on the honorary project for the first course of the Java Specialization, which is a Grayscale image converter.

### R1D8 - July 3rd, 2018

Started working on the Batch Grayscale Converter for the honorary project on the first module of Java Specialization on Coursera. Images are being converted but not saved to disk yet. I'm a bit worried because I'm waking up later each morning and I don't like coding in the nights because I feel like I wasted my day.

### R1D9 - July 4th, 2018

Finished implementing grayscale Image conversion.

### R1D10 - July 5th, 2018

Finally completed the first course of the Coursera Java Specialization. Last project consisted in creating a program for converting images to Grayscale and Inverting their colors. Thinking about creating a super class for image operations and making the grayscale converter and image inverter subclasses of this one. I'm really excited.

### R1D11 - July 6th, 2018

Started with the Course 2 of the Java Specialization, didn't code today, the lesson was not particularly hard, but so far only theory has been given about the Caesar Cipher algorithm as well as testing some pieces of code by hand.

Spent 20 minutes learning about Spring Framework.

### R1D12 - July 8th, 2018

Didn't code yesterday but spent all day modifying my CV because it was not appropiate for a developer Resume. Today didn't track how much I coded but I think I spent more than one hour coding. Started implementing the algorithm for shifting the alphabet to make the Caesar Cipher.

### R1D13 - July 9th, 2018

Worked on the Caesar Cipher program for an hour. Finished implementing all test cases and some working examples, tomorrow I'm going to complete the quizz and finish with the first week of the course. If I have to finish the course quickly, how am I supposed to work on the projects I want to work on?

### R1D14 - July 10th, 2018

Watched some videos explaing the basic concepts of Spring Framework. Didn't code today.

### R1D15 - July 11th, 2018

Finished working on the first week of the second course, passed the quizz with 100% score. Moving on to week two. PS: Don't know how I survived this long without TDD.

### R1D16 - July 12th, 2018

Continued with week 2 of the Coursera course. Coded a little bit, watched some videos, nothing fancy nor complicated. Learned how to use git diff --cached to check the differences of the files I have added to my repo.

### R1D17 - July 13th, 2018

Last night I watched some more videos about Spring Framework, just learning theory for now. Today I implemented a decryption method in the class CaesarCipher. And yesterday I realized that I'm not on week 2 of the course, but on the second part of the first week. Anyways, I've reached the end of module quizz so week 2 will start on monday.

### R1D18-19 - July 14th, 15th, 2018

I have been coding for like six hours straight since 11:00 PM, it's now 5:28 AM, so I'll count this as two days. Working to solve a weird bug when trying to encrypt using two keys, solved it and I want to take a rest for the rest of the day. Finally going to reach week 2.

### R1D20 - July 16th, 2018

Implemented final piece of code for encrypting and decrypting a message using two simple keys. Noticed that a piece of code I thought was badly written was actually not that bad. Reached the end of module quizz but I'll be taking it tomorrow. Also watched more videos that explained things about Spring

### R1D21 - July 17th, 2018

Well, no coding today, just took the end of week 1 quizz. Watched the introduction video for week 2, it looks like this will be a fun project to work with.

### R1D22-23 - July 19th, 2018

Yesterday I spent the day learning about applying design patterns to TDD and how to implement Money pattern with multi currency because I want to use it for something I did at work. Today I continued advancing with week two of the Coursera specialization.

### R1D24 - July 20th, 2018

Reached end of the first half of week 2 for the Coursera specialization. Yesterday I was practicing how to implement an immutable stack and some more design patterns for TDD. Also started working on implementing Money pattern in a program I made at work because I think that would help me process fields with currencies a lot easier.

### R1D25 - July 21st, 2018

Completed first half of week 2 on the Coursera specialization. Yesterday I changed the Money class to use a BigDecimal instead of an int, found a weird bug which took me hours to figure out, but in the end I solved it. Remember int == int, but BigDecimal.equals(BigDecimal), BigDecimal == BigDecimal compares references instead of the values stored.

### R1D26 - July 22nd, 2018

Continued advancing week 2 of the coursera Java Specialization, almost completed all assignments for week 2 in one day. Improved the code for some of the past exercises to use HashMaps instead of ArrayList.
