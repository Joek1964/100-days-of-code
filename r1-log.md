## Log

### R1D1 
Started a book exchange / marketplace app. Setup the main framework with Node and HAPI. Setup Routing, and also added Swagger to document the API.  The basic API now returns the data in JSON format from the CSV input.

The data file cleanup took a bit of time. Had to also wrap the _fs.ReadFile_ in a _Promise_. Need to set up a database and also make the code available online. That's for another day. Will link to Tweet for now.
