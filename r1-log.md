## Log

### Day 1: 20191001, Tue

**Today's Progress**: Forked the [100DaysOfCode project] (https://www.100daysofcode.com/). Updates will be made to this log from sourcetree. 
Goal is to get some working python code that can make REST API calls to complete simple tasks on BIG-IP, BIG-IQ, and in multiple environments like AWS, GCP, Azure, etc. 

Method is to use an existing linuxacademy account for some training vids

[Introduction to Python Development] (https://linuxacademy.com/cp/modules/view/id/311)
[Programming Use Cases with Python] (https://linuxacademy.com/cp/modules/view/id/383)
[Python 3 Scripting for System Administrators] (https://linuxacademy.com/cp/modules/view/id/168)

, [talkpython repo ] (https://github.com/talkpython/100daysofcode-with-python-course) to get ideas on topics to cover, and also spend time working on my REST API code. 

Built lab using altinstall

```
# python3.7 --version
Python 3.7.4
# pip3.7 --version
pip 19.2.3 from /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pip (python 3.7)
```

**Thoughts:** Daunting but I like the idea of being held accountable. Not looking for perfection, but rather consistency and deliberate practice :)
