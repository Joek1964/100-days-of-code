## Log

### R1D1 - June 24th, 2018
Completed four Pomodoros of work on the Baby Names Project for the Coursera specialization, it felt great. https://github.com/mr2much/CourseraSpecialization.git

### R1D2 - June 25th, 2018
Worked on the Baby Names Project for one hour, implemented tests cases for getting a name of the same rank than another given name, and another test case for getting the year in which a given name had the highest rank. Still thinking of implementing a UI to this thing. How would I apply Agile to this project if it is already ongoing?
