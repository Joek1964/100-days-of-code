## Log Summaries

> [R1D4](./logs/D4.md) 
Too many a-holes in the world... I just don't have the trust required to share anymore. Sorry guys. Need to find a community of decent people. This all out thing... demons bruh.

> [R1D3](./logs/D3.md) 
Saw a possible solution. Tracked it far enough to over extend my thalamus. Discovered a lot about routing, more to practice of course, but have touched it for future reference. 

> [R1D2](./logs/D2.md)  
Domestication begins for awhile... Hopefully I can hold on to what I have learned until I get time to dive back in.

> [R1D1](./logs/D1.md)  
Initial PHP Pathing in place!

> [R1D0](./logs/D0.md)  
Committed to the __100-Days-Of-Code__ challenge!
