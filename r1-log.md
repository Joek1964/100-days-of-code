# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 1: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Hackerrank for bash scripting

**Thoughts:** I was trying to decide on a project to work on. I chose bash scripting because there is project at work that I have been wanting to work on that would parse and aggregate specific logs.

Day 2: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp and CodeWars

**Thoughts:** I decided to switch my focus because I didn't want to mix work with this project and get burned out. I decided to do FreeCodeCamp because I wanted to get back into web development. In late high school/early college I kind of ran the other direction from web design and development. I didn't feel like I was creative enough to do it. I still feel that way, but I would like to refresh my skills. I also would like to learn more about back end development. 

I work for a Big Data company and want to learn more about managing data. Python seems to be the language to focus on, so I've been practicing on CodeWars and Hackerrank.

Day 3: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** I started to get sick yesterday, so I skipped a day. I wanted to make sure I kept the momentum going. I mainly focused on FreeCodeCamp so I am more comfortable with Front End development. It seems like a lot has changed and CSS is more powerful... But then again, who knows if I was using it right back then. I just remember the coolest thing to do to your website was put a shadow on the text and place text on the page using div tags...

Day 4: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Set up git for this challenge. Started designing website I want to work on with my husband. Not much yet, but hoping to make some good progress on it.

**Thoughts:** There are so many options now to create your website. It is kind of overwhelming. Our site will start with blogging so I'm looking at WordPress and how I can take advantage of what it has to offer. The project may change though depending on what else I may learn along the way

Day 5: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created a projects folder for this repo and started building animal_counter. Not yet finished, but at least the idea is outlined and I'm ready to finish it tomorrow. Had some fun learning git as well...

**Thoughts:** I had to skip another day because I was sick. Thankfully I am feeling better now and I hope that I'll be 100% tomorrow. I started thinking about what I wanted to work on yesterday though and thought about an interview question I was given. It was a very simple programming question, but because I hadn't coded in a long time and I didn't expect it (it was for a support job, not developer) I did very poorly. It was that experience that really highlighted how important it is to practice coding regularly. So what better way to pay tribute to that moment, than to actually carry out the code.
