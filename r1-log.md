## Log

### R1D1 
Joing the Python Course on https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python I complete 19% of it, it was my first time working with the "datetime" library.
by watching a tutorial on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9fIBT2NBGY, now I can use Git to make version of my code and to publish it on a public server [I recommend everyone who want to start working with git and github to watch it]

### R1D2
