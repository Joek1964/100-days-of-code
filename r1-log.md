The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on May 28th, 2018.

## Log

### R1D1 
Started a book exchange / marketplace app. Setup the main framework with Node and HAPI. Setup Routing, and also added Swagger to document the API.  The basic API now returns the data in JSON format from the CSV input.

The data file cleanup took a bit of time. Had to also wrap the _fs.ReadFile_ in a _Promise_. Need to set up a database and also make the code available online. That's for another day. Will link to Tweet for now.

### R1D2
Fixed errors in Swagger that made testing the API calls fail and show no response. Was due to a CORS issue. Also tested several APIs for getting info from ISBN numbers. Created a repo for the project and mirrored it so that it is now on Github and Gitlab.

Small little things can cause so much aggravation and pain. Case in point, the CORS issue. Was caused by the server being configured with **_0.0.0.0_** as the host, and the browser checking **_localhost_** :) APIs also seem to change. Product API now needs confirmation and approval of Amazon Associate, which you only get with 3 purchases in 180 days which then triggers a review process.

### R1D3
Separated back end from front end in same repo. Back end is in Node + Hapi, Front end is in Angular 6 and Material. Also added Mocha, and Chai for testing purposes

Have to wrap my head around testing with Mocha and Chai before moving full speed ahead on the project. Need to get up to speed with the intricacies of Typescript and ES6.

### R1D4
Working on Angular and Material. Fixed several errors. Created a new component and set up the basic version of it.

Lots of work still to do. Need to format the JSON output from the API into a better version. Still need to better understand some of the Angular 6 intricacies. The Material and FlexLayout for Angular6 are just not as well documented as the one for AngularJs.

### R1D5
JSON output from API endpoint works now.
Booklist now shows book covers from the OpenLibrary API.

Need to get better data source for the API. Improve Layout. Need to study Material and Flex a bit more in depth for Angular 6. Still having trouble getting it to do what could be easily done in Angular 1x with Material

### R1D6
**Lambda** functions, **serverless architecture** oh my! :)
Planning on moving some of my projects to **AWS** to better utilize serverless architecture

Didn't code yesterday. Did tutorials & read up on new tech that I want to use, but no code so doesn't count.

### R1D7
API research and testing for book metadata retrieval and some coding around [SQLite](http://bit.ly/2sCFnhy) to prepare for the main core of the project

Need to work more on testing with [Mocha](http://bit.ly/2HlFwLK) and [Chai](http://bit.ly/2sBuZXw). I am not being very consistent. I find it a little tricky to set up and I get too impatient

### R1D8
Studied and tried out various service worker scripts and AWS Lambda. Focused on Angular 6.

Serverless architecture is really interesting!

### R1D9
Partially migrated a theme from Pixelarity to a Ghost Theme. This will be used as the main site for my projects and I will be moving some of the jquery scripts to Angular 6.

Could not do any coding apart from work related coding for the last couple of days. Not giving up though .. just restarting with vigor.

### R1D10
Worked on website for the project. Should be ready and public in a couple of days

Wonder whether it is better to keep website, angular app, and api separate or to run them unified

### R1D11
Did some coding tests and working through some advanced Angular 6 concepts

Going to keep the three parts separate for now.
