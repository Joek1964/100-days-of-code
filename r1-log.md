# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Audrey Delgado]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [May 21, 2018, Monday].

## Log

### R1D1 
I forked some repos, read some blogs, and worked on my NodeJS project for my client. 

### R1D2 -R1D3
I learned some more about Github Repos, and set some goals.  For my hour of code, I worked more on my NodeJS application. 

### R1D4

FreeCodeCamp for just an hour.  

###R1D5

I Forked some more Repos, and setup some goals.  I have resolved to learn Algorithms, DataStructures, and NodeJS.  I set up some resources and created a repo that will track my Algorithm learning journey.  It might just be notes, or it might be examples...or both.  I don't know how I plan on structuring it, yet. One hour for FreeCodeCamp, today.  5 hours spent on my nodeJS project.  I am reading 1 hour of Algorithms for Dummies (See my Learning-Algorithms repo for citation on that book).  I am also going to look into Python today, too, since it is what is used most in my books for now.
