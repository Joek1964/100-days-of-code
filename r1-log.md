# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Ismail ElFadli]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [December 10, Sunday, 2017].

## Log

### R1D1 
Joing the Python Course on https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python I complete 19% of it, it was my first time working with the "datetime" library.
by watching a tutorial on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9fIBT2NBGY, now I can use Git to make version of my code and to publish it on a public server [I recommend everyone who want to start working with git and github to watch it]

### R1D2
I start coding at night with **R**.
Get started with *Bioconductor* package in *R*, *BSgenome* package to work with whole-genome sequence data, using **seqnames** function to find the names of each chromosome on the genome : ```seqnames(BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19)```. wanna know the length of the chromosome, just write: ```length(hg19[["chr22"]]).```
The **alphabetFrequency** function is a very useful and eficient tool provided by Biostrings for calculating the number of occurences of each DNA base within a given DNAString. ```alphabetFrequency(hg19[["chr22"]],baseOnly=TRUE)``` using baseOnly to tell the function to use only valid DNA bases.
Finding the occurs of seq:
```
s1 <- "aaaatgcagtaacccatgccc"
matchPattern("atg", s1)
```
### R1D3
Even I was tired, I traveled from Rabat to Marrakech, I didn't want to sleep until done my work.
I continue my progress on Python Course (codeacademy) **if, elif, else**, and then I move to Linux with **H3ABioNet** course ( I did the first assignment), how to move throgh linux environment (absolute path, relative path, pwd, ls, mkdir, rmdir).
