## Code Log

## 2: Javascript Fundamentals

### R1D2: Friday, January 4, 2019
---
* Back to Javascript Basics. Currently following the Pluralsight Javascript path. Took a Skill IQ Test earlier on where my score was 124. I'll be taking another test on the 13th of Jan to check how I'm progressing. In addition to this I'm using a number of other resources to enhance my learning experience. These include the [Head First Javascript Book] (https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-JavaScript-Programming-Brain-Friendly/dp/144934013X), MDN, and helpful articles from industry experts.
* Covered operators, functions and scope, objects and arrays while looking at how they fit into the bigger picture of the small blackjack game.

#### Thoughts

* I think the key here is practice, lots of it. I also came across helpful stuff from [Zell Liew] (https://zellwk.com/blog/) which I think will be helpful later.
* I noticed something I struggle with sometimes, not exactly knowing when I'm ready to move to the next stage of learning
* To do: Write the blackjack game with different parameters without hand-holding

## 1: Markdown

### R1D1: Thursday, January 3, 2019
---
* Finally got familiar with Markdown, proceeded to update the repo, taking lots of inspiration from [James Priest] (https://github.com/james-priest)

#### Thoughts

* Markdown is very interesting, feel I should have known about this earlier. Used this handy cheatsheet to learn most of the stuff (https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) 
* James is an inspiration, I love the committment he's put into this challenge. It's a motivation for me to not break the cycle.

### R1D0 - Prep
---
* Deep dive into Git, set up the #100DaysOfCode logging repository
* Check up old progress on a small JS game I was coding along to while learning the basic syntax

#### Thoughts

* Optimistic about the journey ahead, I get roughly two hours to do extra work, aside from my day job. Determined to make the most of it.
