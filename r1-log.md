# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Derek]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [April 18, 2019].

## Log

### R1D1 
Today's Progress**: Learned how to make a simple informational console application informing the user about some characteristics of Python. 

Thoughts: Digging a little deeper into Python helps me to understand why it is the world's favored language. Today I learned about the {} .format() method for injecting variables into a string, several ways to use the input() function, using ctrl+e to comment out sections in Geany, and using an if statement with the colon which is a little different than C but still very intuitive. I really think that Python could become my language of choice if I keep diving in.

### R1D2
Today's Progress**: Learned how to use .append() function, import directive, and negative index numbers in a list

Thoughts: I am enjoying Python so far. Although small pieces of code seem to take a long time because I need to look things up, once I do it once or twice it is very intuitive.

### R1D3
Today's Progress**: I made my first successful while loop in Python using the Fibonacci sequence and based on user input. I also learned my way aroung Github a little better. 

Thoughts**: Even though for loops are in most cases superior to while loops, the programs I have written for C++ and C# always used for loops so I haven't really used while loops much at all. As a beginner in Python I figured I would start learning the right way and use one to do a Fibonacci sequence, which I found a bit tricky at first. I learned the value of stepping away from the machine for a few minutes and coming back. I am not happy with the video presentation on Twitter, as the tweet was in two pieces, and my video and audio quality are still pretty bad. I am, however, happy with my progress in Python for the day.

### R1D4
Today's Progress**: Today I used a lot of new methods, including pop(), insert(), str(), max(), min(), stdev(), variance(), and mean(). I learned that I need to import the statistics module if I want to use certain methods. I created random numbers within a loop (my first Python for loop). I first used ctrl+y to undo a previous edit. Tomorrow I want to study more about definite vs. indefinite iterations. 

Thoughts: I learned a lot today but I felt that it came quicker than before. I feel my journey is well underway now. I had some problems first importing the statistics module; it didn't seem as if I had that module at first but upon the second try, the auto-complete/intellisense kicked in and I knew at that moment that it was there. Everything worked from that point in. This is the second day that I ran into some roadblocks trying to do what I wanted to do. I realize that harder times are ahead but I also know that is the only way to really learn something.

### R1D5
Today's Progress**: Used pow() to raise a number to a power and bin() to convert an output variable to binary code. I also used another while loop today, creating an 'infinite loop' so that a user may input data as many times as needed to test the algorithm. 

Thoughts: Today, on Day 5, I finally felt like I can turn on the editor and start to write a simple program that makes some sense without having to look everything up. It is helping me to write things out on paper using a diagram or pseudocode before I just start typing. I think that is the key to writing efficient code. I really do, however, feel that it takes too long to crank out certain pieces of simple code, such as today's while loop. While I can type it quickly, sometimes putting a math problem into Python language proves to be something I have to look up. I am hoping to speed up soon. I still am producing crude videos on twitter but am going to try using a new app tomorrow to record video internally, while making multiple apps visible.

### R1D
Today's Progress**: I learned about the sort() and sort(reverse=True) method, what the error message EOF means, ways to sanitize user input, and combining 'or' operators (in fact, I hadn't used an or operator in Python before-I was trying to type ||). I learned about the elif() statement but I didn't actually use it for my program, as I need to drill down deeper into the logic. I made ASCII art in the console, and even that was a bit of a challenge because I learned that I need to cut off the quotation marks right after the last character of input. All-in-all, I worked all day learning Python. Luckily, I am a teacher and am on summer holiday with the school system I work for, so I have time. 

Thoughts: Today was the most challenging so far. I really wanted to get the Monty Hall problem complete, but also wanted to sanitize user input and make a little bit of ASCII art at the top illustrating each of the three doors. The real challenge came at the end. After repeated testing, I knew that my probabilities were not coming out right. Continued manipulation of the if-else statements at the end finally gave me statistically accurate results. I also dealt with some hardware issues when I had a mouse freeze up. I found a good video editor but then I was having difficulty converting the .AVI file to .MOV or .MP4. Then I was able to convert but not able to upload to twitter. I finally got that problem solved as well but the public video will only play on an iPhone but not Windows10. I will add that issue to my to-do list for catch-up stuff. I learned more today than any other day and the reason I got caught up so many times was because I am pushing myself hard. I refuse to copy any other code, but insist on figuring out problems on my own.
