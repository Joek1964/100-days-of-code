The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [December 3, 2019].

Day 1: December 3, 2019

Today's Progress: Finished up HTML Essential Course @lynda, I need to consolidate my learning.

Thoughts: At first, it looked so easy but it has some key-points to learn more and more.

Day 2: December 4, 2019

Today's Progress: Studied CSS and HTML, forked 100-days-of-code project. I watched some github videos, but I couldn't manage to do a pull request. I will figure out tomorrow.

Thoughts: I like interactive apps like SoloLearn, it gives me motivation when I see everyone is doing the same thing like a virtual school. I made some progress in HTML and CSS.

Day 3: December 5, 2019

Today's Progress: I have found my mistake while cloning a repo.I mistakenly didn't check where I cloned and everything got messed up. I couldn't make any changes since I couldn't find the local file.After reading and checking some websites, I could delete and clone and tracked the local file at last.I ddid Sololearn exercises, and tried to write some code about how to build a blog.

Thoughts: I noticed that it's better to think and analyze myself rather than relying on tutorials.Practice is the best and permanent solution.

Day 4: December 6, 2019

Today's Progress: I focused on finishing SoloLearn course and I did. But I didn't understand the parts related to JavaScript. I will look at them after learning JS.Then, I read some documentation and watching w3cx courses.

Thougts: I am feeling overwhelmed by so many courses and resources.I don't know so many things. I hope I will have enough knowledge to build my own projects soon. I'll do my best to achieve that!Again, I will learn HTML and CSS, because I don't know totally.

Day 5: December 7, 2019

Today's Progress: I studied at FreeCodeCamp and finished CSS section and moved on to Applied Visual Design.I stopped in the middle, I decided to learn more first, about what is written, I checked lynda course. Then, I downloaded Adobe Photoshop, and learnt a little. My computer got slow down, and it made me go nuts!

Thoughts: I decided to not to compare myself to others, because my life and my background is totally different, I'm a different person, I will just focus on my progress.I wish I had a better and fast computer to work for Adobe Creative Cloud apps.

Day 6: December 8, 2019

Today's Progress: I worked with a blog project and tried to understand and worked with CSS on FreeCodeCamp.

Thoughts: I think I need to immerse everything before moving more. I will use and practice what I learnt.

Day 7: December 9, 2019

Today's Progress: I watched TraversyMedia video and did CSS practice, and watching and taking notes while watching an EdX course.

Thoughts: I'm feeling like I'm moving so slow,but i have decided I will focus on what I'm learning not focusing on progress. Because you can move so quick but if i won't remember later, there is no use for me. So, take it slow. Relax and enjoy!

Day 8: December 10, 2019

Today's progress: I felt like I have so many information and I need to group them altogether. That's why I decided to create my own templates. I checked everything I wrote on my notebooks and files on my computer.Then, I found one tutorial about how to design a form, I decided to watch and practice at the same time. I couldn't finish because I don't know some parts.I will finish tomorrow.

Feelings: I wish I had more time to learn especially know, but impossible.I'm doing whatever I can. I will continue to FreeCodeCamp;but I have so many other resources, too. I don't know which way to go. All of them is highly interesting!

Today's Progress: I decided to work with Tribute Page project. It has become a huge help for me to understand all the CSS properties. I'm feeling I' m getting the logic better now.

Feelings: I was more involved in concepts while making the project. Now, I understand why it's really important to make my hands dirty and tackle the problems myself. I see them now like a learning resource, really important.

Day 12: December 14, 2019

Today's Progress: I finished CSS Essential Training on Lynda.com then I started another CSS course about building an online resume page.I worked on Codepen and tried some CSS code on my project. I watched a little WesBos CSS Grid videos. They look so awesome.Learnt  about CSS Regions, Columns, and Exclusions.

Feelings: I wanted to do more than this but I couldn't finish all that I wanted. I don't know how to manage my time. I have so many things to do and continue to FreeCodeCamp.

Day 13: December 15, 2019

Today's Progress: I finished my Survey Page project and finished CSS Grid and Flexbox parts in FreeCodeCamp. Reviewed animations and transitions.

Day 16: December 19, 2019

Today's Progress: I studied on SoloLearn and searched some questions that I didn't quite undertsand. Continued to my project and finished it but I have some problem with my grid and images.

Feelings: I can focus for longer hours while coding now. I need to plan before coding. Every part of the project got messed up becuase I didn't group them before hand. But, I'm learning everyday, this should make it better.

Day 17: December 20, 2019

Today's Progress: I did "Technical Documentation Page" on freeCodeCamp, I will try to design navigation bar.I read some blogs and listened to syntax podcast,read some information on w3schools and MDN.

I will try to fix that tomorrow. Then, I did challenge with logical questions, I learned so many new terms and HTML tags, it was informative. Then, I started to learn about Skeleton and started my last project. I found a very good course.I'm following that course, too. And, I finished one project about navigation bars with a video.

Feelings: I am feeling so happy actually, I wish I could discover this area before going to university. I never had any chance to see such websites before. This year I learned so many things and all by myself. This is incredible. I think school didn't teach me anything and I am really sad about that.

Day 19: December 22, 2019

Today's Progress: I continued on my last project. Portfolio page, styling is really making me stressful. I see that there are better options than using CSS. I want to learn other frameworks and and Adobe products to make it better the style. But, I got my certificate anyway. I'm happy that I finished; but I will keep coming back again.In this 20 days almost, I got so many certificates and different resources, it's amazing, I will share my certificates from Lynda, Sololearn and FreeCodeCamp.

Feelings: I'm happy but I haven't mastered everything yet; I listened to traversymedia and he also said we don't need to be a master in CSS before moving onto JS. That's why I will continue to learn different stuff, it is necessary to learn and combine different languages or programs.

Feelings: I also started doing yoga challenge today, I felt a little stressed and I wanted to relax by listening to self-awareness videos and watching women in tech videos. I looked through FCC blog and it looks so helpful.

Day 23 : December 26, 2019

Today's Progress: I'm studying JavaScript basics on FreeCodeCamp, SoloLearn and The Odin Project. I hope I will learn very well and it will be not so hard.

Feelings: I am so sleepy and lazy these days. It is so hard to open my eyes sometimes, I'm fasting or maybe my sleeping pattern changed a lot. They can cause this and I am waking up early without sleeping enough. I don't know what to do. Let's see.

Day 24 : December 27, 2019

Today's Progress: I managed to study on freeCodeCamp, finished almost half of the JavaScript challenges and did a little SoloLearn. Also, continued with Lynda course.

Day 25 : December 28, 2019

Today's Progress: I searched through all the bookmarks that I had before, and checked out the websites. I decided to take FrontEnd Masters courses, I started with Web Development and git by Brian Holt; after that I continued with Kyle Simpson's javaScript course. Tomorrow I will continue.

Feelings: These days I am feeling so distracted; that's why I searched through what I can do. First, I found a Coursera course about how to study and I will take that course when it is accepted. The, I listened to "Getting Things Done". I understood my problem and I will use the strategies like instructed in the video. It looks so effective. I am planning to be more organized. I need to work systematically and I should have a schedule including every hour and everyday.

Day 26 : December 29, 2019

Today's Progress : I started with lynda course and learnt functions and closures. It took me a while. I did some FreeCodeCamp and 3/4 finished.

Feelings: I decided to manage my time and focus better. I am gonna check myself when I lose track of what I am doing. I am feeling motivated for new year.

Day 27 : December 30, 2019

Today's Progress : I tried to use CodeAcademy, it was looking good; but I checked the comments and I experienced also that their course system is not organized. Then I continued with lynda course. Learning about DOM, query selectors and elements.

Feelings: I'm having some mental issues; I'm trying to push myself; but my brain is making me so hopeless. I want to achieve something; but there is always something in my brain telling me "No, you cannot do that!". I'm trying to motivate myself and learning about time and focus management; I am feeling so sleepy suddenly while studying or I'm getting distracted easily. I asked to my boyfriend about this. He is always motivated when he wants to do something and he told me that I learned so many things in this whole year and it's better to compare myself with the year before.I think he is right, I want to be like those people who are getting jobs and being a master in everything; but I am not seeing my progress. Ok, I will read motivational posts but I will try not to compare myself with others. In this new year, I am planning to learn and feeling good about it not thinking about other people's progress; but only mine.

Today's Progress : I studied on Udacity about Github. I want to work on Github more this year. I studied a little about class methods on Mozilla Developer.

Feelings: I felt so alone today, it's the last day of 2019 and I am alone. However, I searched about Udacity free courses and scholarships and Coursera courses. I applied to them. It took some of my time. I felt a little sleepy again but I didn't sleep; but I could use my time wisely.

Day 29 : January 1, 2020

Today's Progress: I studied about how to write inline CSS with JavaScript and how to combine DOM elements. After that, I studied on FreeCodeCamp and udacity.

Learnt about black boxing, abstraction, polymorhism,encapsulation and inheritance.

Feelings: I was feeling so happy and energetic today. I want to achieve my goals this year. I felt so motivated. I hope this feeling won't change.  But I'm feeling still not so knowledgeable about what I have been studying yet there are so many syntax rules and I don't know how to use them in a problem. I started to Intro to JavaScript and I want to continue there. Their system is good.

Westarted with git, I was stuck and I couldn't solve the problem, I started to watch udacity course then tried, tried, searhed,read so many things and found my silly mistake. Then, I moved on to freeaCodeCamp to learn deconstructing assignment, also learned from a little Lynda course; but I didn't fullly ubderstand. I need to learn deeper. After that, I did a little Odin Project readings and practices, I really liked, they are so effective and have good repetitions. Then, I moved on to watchandcode; but I decided to learn DOM fully with Odin project and it took me to Traversy Media. I watched one 40 minute video and at the end I learned about workflow tools, extensions, plug-ins and add-ons. Learned more about JavaScript,html and CSS debugging.

Feelings: I am feling great, I think those positive thinking videos are making me to focus on positive things and keep me positive. I will not make myself upset anymore. It's okay to be slow, I am learning a lot.

 Day 41: January 13, 2020

 Today's Progress: I read JavaScript book and solved test about HTML, CSS an JavaScript. I felt like I don't know anything. I will revise my learning. I did Pomodoro for the first time. I liked it, it keeps me more organized and focused. I will continue to learn about the concepts more because logic is so important in programming.

 Feelings: I am motivated; but really it's so hard to retain information. I got started Coursera course, I will watch and learn more about learning.

 Day 42: January 14, 2020

 Today's Progress: Today, I have read and practiced so many things for the exam. I know the concepts like API, WEB Worker, SVG, Canvas, animations with JS. There were so many HTML tags that I didn't know I practiced those.

 Feelings: I want to pass the exam tomorrow; however I am not feeling that everything is on my mind. I just want to certify myself, I know it's not so important but I studied for that already(read books, solved four tests and searched everything), I hope these will be enough.

 Day 43: January 15, 2020

 Today's Progress: I passed the exam, it was so easier than practice questions. I started my Coursera course, I finished the first week. It was about quick review of HTML and CSS and I built a simple webpage. I read and studied about so many things before exam, I will learn those later in detailed.

 Feelings: I am feeling off track a little bit, but I don't just want to stick  myself to FCC, I want to explore and repeat to remember. I am forgetting still even some basic things and I need to improve my web design skills, I'm not so creative. I am listening to creativity talks to improve my thinking.

Day 46: January 18, 2020

Today's Progress: I worked through Coursera and Stanford online course. It took me long time to finish. The assignments were challenging. I don't know why the curriculum is based on image manipulation. I was expecting different. I don't know I will use or not.

Feelings: I'm feeling like I need to know math, but I cannot give my time for that now. It is hard to convert normal words into code. I need deliberate practice and recall. Also, I did my yoga challenge, I couldn't use pomodoro technique so much. I was trying to finish the assignments.

Day 47: January 19, 2020

Today's Progress: I studied on Coursera, first I wanted to practice yesterday's coding. After that, I did practice on DOM and Canvas; but didn't finish all. Then, I studied on Udacity about DOM and canvas. I want to finish them, too.

Day 49: January 21, 2020

Today's Progress: Studied on FreeCodeCamp, debugging and data structures. It was easy; but I have some issues with objects. I need to focus on that. Then, I finished Computer Science Lab: JavaScript on lynda and I studied about DOM on udacity and openclassrooms.

Feelings: In the mornings, I don't have so much energy; I felt empty then, I found one article about kaize, the reason of being. The reason to get out of the bed, I felt I'm not so passionate enough, I mean I feel like I need more resting. I'm studying anyway, just I don't need to start at 8. I am trying to find my kaize.

Day 50: January 22, 2020

Today's Progress: I finished regular expressions sections on FCC; but I am feeling I will forget so quickly. It's like all syntax rules, I think I need a cheat sheet for that. Then, I studied on Sololearn, I wanted to finish JS part but ES6 part is harder a little. I will try to finish tomorrow. I learned how to make animations in JS and event propagation.

Feelings: I wanted to have more time to do more stuff; I have a lot to do and I want to build something; but I am not feeling ready.

Day 51: January 23, 2020

Today's Progress: Today, I finished SoloLearn JavaScript tutorial. Then, I did udacity course of ES6, finished first lesson. Also, did some practice on openclassrooms.

Feelings: I am motivated to learn just sometimes my brain is feeling so fulll; like I'm putting in and in and I'm losing at the end. I don't want this.

Day 52: January 24, 2020

Today's Progress: I completed Coursera course; but I don't know it was useful. Then, I started OOP on FCC; couldn't do much until 30%. Then, I wanted to learn exercism.io; I tried to download, then downloaded; but I don't know how to start solving problems in my editor yet.

FEELINGS: I want to learn useful and practical information from now on. I felt like certificates are not so useful. Really, who cares? I need to learn to build. I don't know the things that I'm giving my time, are not real life examples generally. However, I need to learn to build; I'm so confused. I will just check the courses first; if I'm gonna just watch and listen. I will not start.

Day 53: January 25, 2020

Today's Progress: I studied on openclassrooms and FCC- Object Oriented Programming. There was so much information to take in. I need to study more about those. Also registered Microsoft EDX courseand computational thinking and logic.

Feelings: I felt helpless today, I am feeling so unconfident about my skills, and didn't know what to do. Then, I searched about brain capacity and downloaded apps to improve my brain, I really want to change my mind. I am so regretful about those university years that I was stuck on Instagram , I got very dumb; because of that superficial environment and physical superiority was the first priority in my life. I didn't invest enough to improve myself just crammed the books before exams and graduated without giving enough time to implement. I wish I knew the value of time that time, too.
