# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Balint Pataki

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on 14th December, Monday, 2020.

## My Plan for this challange
I concentrate on two areas:
<ul>
<li>I am going to work on FreeCodeCamp Curriculum (I have already finished Responsive Web Design Certification when I am starting #100DaysOfCode).</li>
<li>As I have programming experience in Python and SQL, I will polish this knowledge as well as I can by building real projects as previously.</li>
</ul>

## Log

### R1D1 
Updated my [portfolio](https://bpataki.com) page and started Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures on [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org). I did 57 challanges out of 111 in that section. 
That was quite logical and easy so far, thanks to my experience in Python and Machine Learning.
