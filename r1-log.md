# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Your Name Here]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [July 17, Monday, 2017].

## Log

### Day 1: 20191001, Tue

**Today's Progress**: Forked the [100DaysOfCode project](https://www.100daysofcode.com/). Updates will be made to this log from sourcetree. 
Goal is to get some working python code that can make REST API calls to complete simple tasks on BIG-IP, BIG-IQ, and in multiple environments like AWS, GCP, Azure, etc. 

Method is to use an existing linuxacademy account for some training vids

[Introduction to Python Development](https://linuxacademy.com/cp/modules/view/id/311)

[Programming Use Cases with Python](https://linuxacademy.com/cp/modules/view/id/383)

[Python 3 Scripting for System Administrators](https://linuxacademy.com/cp/modules/view/id/168)

, [talkpython repo ](https://github.com/talkpython/100daysofcode-with-python-course) to get ideas on topics to cover, and also spend time working on my REST API code. 

Built lab using altinstall

```
# python3.7 --version
Python 3.7.4
# pip3.7 --version
pip 19.2.3 from /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pip (python 3.7)
```

**Thoughts:** Daunting but I like the idea of being held accountable. Not looking for perfection, but rather consistency and deliberate practice :)

### Day 2: 20191002, Wed

**Today's Progress**: 

* Python 3 Scripting for System Administrators - Interacting with files
* exercies 1-3, key points to remember are setting variables up front, then iterate over the list/dict, modifying the var as you go, printing its value at the end. Use += to concatenate. Going forward, think about how you can use other functions to populate those dicts/lists. 

**Thoughts:**:  Wrote my own code before looking at the solution. I need to remember to keep it simple at first. For instance, I tried to do list.append(dict) but should have just defined the list of dicts without making the dicts variables.
