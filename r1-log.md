# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Balint Pataki

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on 14th December, Monday, 2020.

## My Plan for this challange
I concentrate on two areas:
<ul>
<li>I am going to work on FreeCodeCamp Curriculum (I have already finished Responsive Web Design Certification when I am starting #100DaysOfCode).</li>
<li>As I have programming experience in Python and SQL, I will polish this knowledge as well as I can by building real projects as previously.</li>
</ul>

## Log

### R1D1 
Updated my [portfolio](https://bpataki.com) page and started Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures on [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org). I did 57 challanges out of 111 in that section. 
That was quite logical and easy so far, thanks to my experience in Python and Machine Learning.

### R1D2
Did 22 challenges on FCC in JavaScript. 32 more from this section.
Woke up later so I needed to code in the evening, that was not as productive as if I would have done it in the morning.
Updated my [portfolio](https://bpataki.com) page.

### R1D3 
Did 10+ challenges on FCC in JS. 11 more in this section. Learnt about loops. This is very similar to Python, however, Do..While is a new thing for me.

### R1D4
Did 10+ JS challenges on FCC. No time for project work unfortunately, Christmas-time is coming, need to arrange a lot of things in advance.

### R1D5
Started ES6 part of the JS Data Structures and Algorithms sTraining the forest cover #MachineLearning model, added decision tree and random forest classifiers.
Perfect project to refresh and extend my knowledge, to fill the gaps.ection on FCC. Also, I updated my portfolio.
I felt I needed more time to deeply understand the use cases of recursive function and now it is the same as let/const/freeze.
Challenges are great and I can proceed quite easily but I can't wait for the project work. I might want to read a book or search for additional material on JS data structures and algorithms. This part is so important, it is the core of programming.

### R1D6
Deep-dive into ES6 challenges, it is really interesting.
Sometimes I compare JS to Python which is very useful, this way I can have a better understanding on both.

### R1D7
Finished ES6 challenges of FCC. It was massive, even if I could solve everything, this was challenging here and there. 
I need to recap those ideas from another sources. I found You Don't Know JS book which seems extraordinary.
I am currently looking for some project ideas in ML/DL for days when I don't want spend much time on FCC. Considering a web app for time series/RNN or image segmentation.

### R1D8
Did tons of JS regex challenges on #freeCodeCamp.
Lucky to had similar problems to solve before in #Python3.
Also finished a small-scale coding project at work.
Apart from Christmas and family time, it seems to be a month full of coding.

### R1D9
Finished JS Regex and Debugging sections on #freeCodeCamp. Regex was quite challenging at the end.
Really motivated to get better in JavaScript, I think this makes me a better programmer. 
Generally any new language or knowledge makes you better.

### R1D10
Went through some JS data structure challenges on #FreeCodeCamp.
Still exciting about JS and web development.

### R1D11
Finished Data Structures in JS and started Algorithms section on FCC.
Proceeded with #100DaysOfCode translation as well.

### R1D12
Finished Algorithms section on FCC.

### R1D13
Completed the whole OOP section in the #freeCodeCamp curriculum.
Read/watched some other sources about OOP features in JS, at first it was a bit strange without classes.

### R1D14
Did some functional programming challenges and read about it. Quite interesting topic.
I am also planning a Python Data Science project on the side.

### R1D15
Proceeding with Functional Programming challenges on #freeCodeCamp 
Needed to do it before work, but if I find some time after work, I'll continue it.
Can' wait for the projects of this section.

### R1D16
Did some functional programming challenges on #freeCodeCamp. 
Learned a lot about map, filter, reduce and higher order functions. Interesting stuff.
Also contributed to open source today.

### R1D17
Completed JS functional programming challenges on #freeCodeCamp and started a data science project on Kaggle.

### R1D18
Working on intermediate algorithm scripting in Javascript. Challenging sometimes, but I really like it.
Huge plans for the new year. I usually can't wait for the next challenge or project.
Just need to keep discipline and hard work.

### R1D19
Still worked on #freeCodeCamp JS intermediate algorithms. Quite challenging.
Also worked on a data science project on forest cover.
Link: https://github.com/patakib/forest-cover-analysis/blob/master/forest-cover.ipynb

### R1D20
Worked on a data science project (forest cover) in Python and did 7 intermediate algorithm challenges in Javascript on #freeCodeCamp.
Also reinstalled Linux Manjaro on my PC, I really like this OS.

### R1D21
Worked on a data science project (forest cover) in Python and completed a lot of algorithms on freeCodeCamp.
Already did 2 projects from Algorithms and Data Structures section.

### R1D22-23
Worked on a data science project (forest cover) in Python and completed the whole Javascript Data Structures and Algorithms part of #freeCodeCamp.

### R1D24
Working on Bootstrap challenges. I read the relevant parts of the documentation and playing with the features a bit to understand the whole context.

### R1D25
Completed Bootstrap section (I knew it but it was a great refresher) and started with jQuery on #freeCodeCamp.
Wrote a new post about train, validation and test sets:
http://patbalint.pythonanywhere.com/blog/2021/1/8/train-test-and-validation-sets-machine-learning/
Working on the Forest Cover data science project.

### R1D26
Basically there are two parts: project work+#freeCodeCamp challenges.
Currently the project is a classification ML project in #Python and I learn #jQuery on FCC.
The end goal is to connect them together in full stack projects.

### R1D27
Trained the machine learning model with grid search and pipeline. I wanna try at least 5 estimators. This is ongoing.

Before deep-dive into React on #freeCodeCamp, built a miniproject with vanilla #javascript:
https://github.com/patakib/color-picker-tool

### R1D28
Fitted support vector classifier model with the best parameter in the forest cover project.
In case of a huge dataset, you can run Grid Search on a smaller portion and that might provide the best hyperparameters.

### R1D29
Trained #MachineLearning model in #Python and started another #javascript miniproject:
https://github.com/patakib/image-viewer

Front-end need to be heavily practiced before it would be natural. I'll do some miniprojects before proceeding with #React on #freeCodeCamp

### R1D30
I completed a #javascript miniproject. 
https://github.com/patakib/image-viewer
Wanna learn? Do projects. Solve real problems.
If you only do tutorials, the real questions won't be asked and answered. At least modify and play with the code.
Challenge yourself, be active.

### R1D31
#MachineLearning model still training.
Next task is a full stack web project that I started previously. Backend written in #django, db is postgres.
Time to update it and add functionality on #Frontend with #javascript. Seems to be a great learning.

### R1D32
Still try to train the #machineLearning model.
Concentrated on the #FullStack app, this is a ticketing system. CRUD with some styling and #Django.

### R1D33
Made some styling and #javascript functions for filtering and ordering the table in my new app.
I want to deploy this project asap, then continuously develop it further, I have more ideas.

### R1D34
Worked on the deployment of my #django #postgres #javascript project on a PaaS.
Demo will be ready soon.

### R1D35
Working with the forest cover #MachineLearning  project.
Learning #Docker  while the model is being trained :)

### R1D36
Still working with the #django #postgresql #javascript app. Familiarized myself with #Docker, maybe that's an option for this app as well. 
Apart from this, struggling with the training of the #MachineLearning model.

### R1D37
Finished the first phase of my #Django #postgres app, now put on hold.
Learning #reactjs on #freeCodeCamp to widen my knowledge. It'll be useful for this project as well.
Training the ML model in the meantime.

### R1D38
Done #Reactjs challenges on #freeCodeCamp. Learnt about components, JSX. Seems quite logical and useful.
I could predict with my #MachineLearning model (SVC)! Let's evaluate and try other algorithms.
Happy Coding!

### R1D39
Added KNN (K Nearest Neighbor) Classifier to the #MachineLearning model. 
Main goal is to predict the ideal tree species on a site based on the geographic parameters.
Reached 76% accuracy, but still long way to go.

### R1D40
Training the forest cover #MachineLearning model, added decision tree and random forest classifiers.
Perfect project to refresh and extend my knowledge, to fill the gaps.

### R1D41-42
Finished ML project with around 75% accuracy, started a new #DeepLearning project on weather forecasting. I work on #GoogleColab.
Also learning #reactjs on #freeCodeCamp when I need another impulse and for fun. Learned a lot about components.

### R1D43
Learned some #reactjs through #freeCodeCamp challenges, made a simple counter app. Can't wait for the project section. #webdevelopment became a hobby.
In the evening, training a recurrent #neuralnetwork for weather forecasting. More job-related stuff.

### R1D44
Working on plotting of recurrent #neuralnetwork model on weather forecasting.
This will be another great addition to my #DataScience  portfolio.

### R1D45
Working on plotting with #matplotlib #plotly and #seaborn.

### R1D46-47
Updated my portfolio page. Both styling and content needed to be changed.
Good practice for grid and flexbox.
Also updated my projects: added short demo videos and extended readme files and descriptions.

### R1D48
Updated some css on my portfolio and planning my next project.
Also did some #reactjs on #freeCodeCamp.

### R1D49-50
Minor changes on portfolio.
Back to #freeCodeCamp and working on #reactjs challenges.
Planning a new project.

---
Halfway through this challenge.
100 Days of Code really helps me concentrating on the projects. I did almost as many projects in the last 50 days as I had done before this challenge.
I have clear plans for the next weeks, months and I am sure I can grow as a developer.

I wanted to polish my Python knowledge especially in the data science field, which I have done in the past 50 days. This will help me in my career as I use Python a lot during my daily job.

In the other hand, FreeCodeCamp provides a really clear path into web development which I am also interested in. I could proceed really well and quickly so far.
I have a lot of plans in this field as well.

### R1D51
Working on #React challenges on #freeCodeCamp.
It was actually too fast so I need to recap the basics.
I am following a tutorial where I always stop the video and create the app from scratch, play with the code -  every time it proceeds to further steps.

### R1D52
Continuing #reactjs based on a great tutorial.
Always re-creating the code from scratch, messing up, changing and playing with it.
