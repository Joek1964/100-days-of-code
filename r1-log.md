# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Tirawi]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [June 23, Saturday, 2018].

### Day 0: June 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Solve Sum of Digits / Digital Root Toy Problem

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with recursion, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. recursion is still hard to deal with for me, but I am sure that I will master it.
