### `Day 000: 2018-06-23`

**Today's Progress**: Solve Sum of Digits / Digital Root Toy Problem

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with recursion, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. recursion is still hard to deal with for me, but I am sure that I will master it.

**Thoughts**: Working on [FCC](https://www.freecodecamp.org/htirawi) projects become easier as you have to follow the tests and make them pass, I face some problems in centriced things but I solve them. And also I :heart: [codepen](https://codepen.io/htirawi) and working with it! it really helped me with designing.
