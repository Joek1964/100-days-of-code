The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [June 24, Sunday, 2018].

## Log

### R1D1 - June 24th, 2018
Completed four Pomodoros of work on the Baby Names Project for the Coursera specialization, it felt great. https://github.com/mr2much/CourseraSpecialization.git

### R1D2 - June 25th, 2018
Worked on the Baby Names Project for one hour, implemented tests cases for getting a name of the same rank than another given name, and another test case for getting the year in which a given name had the highest rank. Still thinking of implementing a UI to this thing. How would I apply Agile to this project if it is already ongoing?

### R1D3 - June 26th, 2018
Woke up late, only worked for 30 minutes on the Baby Names Project. Implemented a method for getting the average rank of a name in a given range of years. Learned how to round decimal numbers using BigDecimal as suggested by an answer provided by user593581 on a Stack Overflow question, here's the link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/153724/how-to-round-a-number-to-n-decimal-places-in-java

### R1D4 - June 27th, 2018
Woke up way too late today, so I didn't code at my usual hour which is 5:30 AM, will try to code later in the day. Last night I installed Tomcat, Maven and Eclipse for Java EE, and started learning about deploying web apps to deploy the Baby Names Project to the web.

Finally worked on implementing the last test case of the Baby Names Project. Didn't take too long. Now I've got to start working on implementing the project as a web application. Or maybe I should start working on finishing the first module on Coursera, and then working on the project. We'll see.

### R1D5 - June 28th, 2018
Felt a little bit drowzy when I woke up this morning. Coded anyways, changed a bunch of stuff, since the file loading for the class ListByYear. Implemented helper method to extract the year from the filename; also, implemented a method to load a file list by passing it a filename. Also implemented a method for loading a range of files by using a DirectoryResource. Finallly, implemented the last test case and changed previous tests to use the new methods, nothing broke. Going to start working with real implementation of code tomorrow.

### R1D6 - June 30th, 2018

Didn't code at all yesterday. But today coded for like 2 hours, completed at least Pomodoros of work without counting extra time invested without calculating it. Fixed a few implementation issues with getting the total girls, total boys and total overall, since I didn't count the total names but the size of the ArrayList, then had to implement again a code that did just that for one of the test cases. Finished the end of module Quizz for the first module of the Coursera Java Specialization, and now I'm thinking about implementing the Extend Your Program suggestions and the optional Honors Content before moving on to course 2.

### R1D7 - July 2nd, 2018

Didn't code yesterday because I had a family day, and coded only a little bit today because it was my wife's birthday. Anyways, starting working on the honorary project for the first course of the Java Specialization, which is a Grayscale image converter.

### R1D8 - July 3rd, 2018

Started working on the Batch Grayscale Converter for the honorary project on the first module of Java Specialization on Coursera. Images are being converted but not saved to disk yet. I'm a bit worried because I'm waking up later each morning and I don't like coding in the nights because I feel like I wasted my day.

### R1D9 - July 4th, 2018

Finished implementing grayscale Image conversion.

### R1D10 - July 5th, 2018

Finally completed the first course of the Coursera Java Specialization. Last project consisted in creating a program for converting images to Grayscale and Inverting their colors. Thinking about creating a super class for image operations and making the grayscale converter and image inverter subclasses of this one. I'm really excited.
