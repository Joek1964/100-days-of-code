## Log

### R1D1 
Today's Progress**: Learned how to make a simple informational console application informing the user about some characteristics of Python. 

Thoughts: Digging a little deeper into Python helps me to understand why it is the world's favored language. Today I learned about the {} .format() method for injecting variables into a string, several ways to use the input() function, using ctrl+e to comment out sections in Geany, and using an if statement with the colon which is a little different than C but still very intuitive. I really think that Python could become my language of choice if I keep diving in.

### R1D2
Today's Progress: Learned how to use .append() function, import directive, and negative index numbers in a list

Thoughts: I am enjoying Python so far. Although small pieces of code seem to take a long time because I need to look things up, once I do it once or twice it is very intuitive.
