# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Balint Pataki

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on 14th December, Monday, 2020.

## My Plan for this challange
I concentrate on two areas:
<ul>
<li>I am going to work on FreeCodeCamp Curriculum (I have already finished Responsive Web Design Certification when I am starting #100DaysOfCode).</li>
<li>As I have programming experience in Python and SQL, I will polish this knowledge as well as I can by building real projects as previously.</li>
</ul>

## Log

### R1D1 
Updated my [portfolio](https://bpataki.com) page and started Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures on [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org). I did 57 challanges out of 111 in that section. 
That was quite logical and easy so far, thanks to my experience in Python and Machine Learning.

### R1D2
Did 22 challenges on FCC in JavaScript. 32 more from this section.
Woke up later so I needed to code in the evening, that was not as productive as if I would have done it in the morning.
Updated my [portfolio](https://bpataki.com) page.

### R1D3 
Did 10+ challenges on FCC in JS. 11 more in this section. Learnt about loops. This is very similar to Python, however, Do..While is a new thing for me.

### R1D4
Did 10+ JS challenges on FCC. No time for project work unfortunately, Christmas-time is coming, need to arrange a lot of things in advance.

### R1D5
Started ES6 part of the JS Data Structures and Algorithms section on FCC. Also, I updated my portfolio.
I felt I needed more time to deeply understand the use cases of recursive function and now it is the same as let/const/freeze.
Challenges are great and I can proceed quite easily but I can't wait for the project work. I might want to read a book or search for additional material on JS data structures and algorithms. This part is so important, it is the core of programming.

### R1D6
Deep-dive into ES6 challenges, it is really interesting.
Sometimes I compare JS to Python which is very useful, this way I can have a better understanding on both.

### R1D7
Finished ES6 challenges of FCC. It was massive, even if I could solve everything, this was challenging here and there. 
I need to recap those ideas from another sources. I found You Don't Know JS book which seems extraordinary.
I am currently looking for some project ideas in ML/DL for days when I don't want spend much time on FCC. Considering a web app for time series/RNN or image segmentation.

### R1D8
Did tons of JS regex challenges on #freeCodeCamp.
Lucky to had similar problems to solve before in #Python3.
Also finished a small-scale coding project at work.
Apart from Christmas and family time, it seems to be a month full of coding.

### R1D9
Finished JS Regex and Debugging sections on #freeCodeCamp. Regex was quite challenging at the end.
Really motivated to get better in JavaScript, I think this makes me a better programmer. 
Generally any new language or knowledge makes you better.

### R1D10
Went through some JS data structure challenges on #FreeCodeCamp.
Still exciting about JS and web development.

### R1D11
Finished Data Structures in JS and started Algorithms section on FCC.
Proceeded with #100DaysOfCode translation as well.

### R1D12
Finished Algorithms section on FCC.

### R1D13
Completed the whole OOP section in the #freeCodeCamp curriculum.
Read/watched some other sources about OOP features in JS, at first it was a bit strange without classes.

### R1D14
Did some functional programming challenges and read about it. Quite interesting topic.
I am also planning a Python Data Science project on the side.

### R1D15
Proceeding with Functional Programming challenges on #freeCodeCamp 
Needed to do it before work, but if I find some time after work, I'll continue it.
Can' wait for the projects of this section.

### R1D16
Did some functional programming challenges on #freeCodeCamp. 
Learned a lot about map, filter, reduce and higher order functions. Interesting stuff.
Also contributed to open source today.

### R1D17
Completed JS functional programming challenges on #freeCodeCamp and started a data science project on Kaggle.

### R1D18
Working on intermediate algorithm scripting in Javascript. Challenging sometimes, but I really like it.
Huge plans for the new year. I usually can't wait for the next challenge or project.
Just need to keep discipline and hard work.

### R1D19
Still worked on #freeCodeCamp JS intermediate algorithms. Quite challenging.
Also worked on a data science project on forest cover.

### R1D20
Worked on a data science project (forest cover) in Python and did 7 intermediate algorithm challenges in Javascript on #freeCodeCamp.
Also reinstalled Linux Manjaro on my PC, I really like this OS.

### R1D21
Worked on a data science project (forest cover) in Python and completed a lot of algorithms on freeCodeCamp.
Already did 2 projects from Algorithms and Data Structures section.

### R1D22-23
Worked on a data science project (forest cover) in Python and completed the whole Javascript Data Structures and Algorithms part of #freeCodeCamp.

### R1D24
Working on Bootstrap challenges. I read the relevant parts of the documentation and playing with the features a bit to understand the whole context.
