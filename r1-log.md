The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [April 18, 2019].

## Log

### R1D1 
Today's Progress**: Learned how to make a simple informational console application informing the user about some characteristics of Python. 

Thoughts: Digging a little deeper into Python helps me to understand why it is the world's favored language. Today I learned about the {} .format() method for injecting variables into a string, several ways to use the input() function, using ctrl+e to comment out sections in Geany, and using an if statement with the colon which is a little different than C but still very intuitive. I really think that Python could become my language of choice if I keep diving in.

### R1D2
Today's Progress: Learned how to use .append() function, import directive, and negative index numbers in a list

Thoughts: I am enjoying Python so far. Although small pieces of code seem to take a long time because I need to look things up, once I do it once or twice it is very intuitive.

### R1D3
Today's Progress: I made my first successful while loop in Python using the Fibonacci sequence and based on user input. I also learned my way aroung Github a little better. 

Thoughts: Even though for loops are in most cases superior to while loops, the programs I have written for C++ and C# always used for loops so I haven't really used while loops much at all. As a beginner in Python I figured I would start learning the right way and use one to do a Fibonacci sequence, which I found a bit tricky at first. I learned the value of stepping away from the machine for a few minutes and coming back. I am not happy with the video presentation on Twitter, as the tweet was in two pieces, and my video and audio quality are still pretty bad. I am, however, happy with my progress in Python for the day.
