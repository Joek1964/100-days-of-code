# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Bill Hall]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [October 9, 2020].

## Log
I copied some requirements from a job listing that I would like to have, and will focus on learning those requirements initially. Since I am interested in a front end position, I will mainly focus on learning front end stuff.

Requirements:

    You have a deep understanding of HTML, CSS, and JS.
    You keep up with the latest technologies (CSS Grid, Flexbox, Web Animations API, Observers, etc.) and understand how and when to use feature detection, polyfills, @supports, and vendor-prefixes to provide cross-browser support.
    You are comfortable with templating engines like Mustache or Handlebars.
    You have experience using RESTful APIs in your applications.

Preferred Requirements:

    Familiarity with Vue.js or similar frameworks is a plus.
    Familiarity with progressive enhancement is a plus.
    Familiarity with MongoDB or other NoSQL databases is a plus.
