Day 1: December 3, 2019

Today's Progress: Finished up HTML Essential Course @lynda, I need to consolidate my learning.

Thoughts: At first, it looked so easy but it has some key-points to learn more and more.

Day 2: December 4, 2019

Today's Progress: Studied CSS and HTML, forked 100-days-of-code project. I watched some github videos, but I couldn't manage to do a pull request. I will figure out tomorrow.

Thoughts: I like interactive apps like SoloLearn, it gives me motivation when I see everyone is doing the same thing like a virtual school. I made some progress in HTML and CSS.

Day 3: December 5, 2019

Today's Progress: I have found my mistake while cloning a repo.I mistakenly didn't check where I cloned and everything got messed up. I couldn't make any changes since I couldn't find the local file.After reading and checking some websites, I could delete and clone and tracked the local file at last.I ddid Sololearn exercises, and tried to write some code about how to build a blog.

Thoughts: I noticed that it's better to think and analyze myself rather than relying on tutorials.Practice is the best and permanent solution.

Day 4: December 6, 2019

Today's Progress: I focused on finishing SoloLearn course and I did. But I didn't understand the parts related to JavaScript. I will look at them after learning JS.Then, I read some documentation and watching w3cx courses.

Thougts: I am feeling overwhelmed by so many courses and resources.I don't know so many things. I hope I will have enough knowledge to build my own projects soon. I'll do my best to achieve that!Again, I will learn HTML and CSS, because I don't know totally. 

Day 5: December 7, 2019

Today's Progress: I studied at FreeCodeCamp and finished CSS section and moved on to Applied Visual Design.I stopped in the middle, I decided to learn more first, about what is written, I checked lynda course. Then, I downloaded Adobe Photoshop, and learnt a little. My computer got slow down, and it made me go nuts!

Day 7: December 9, 2019

Today's Progress: I watched TraversyMedia video and did CSS practice, and watching and taking notes while watching an EdX course.

Thoughts: I'm feeling like I'm moving so slow,but i have decided I will focus on what I'm learning not focusing on progress. Because you can move so quick but if i won't remember later, there is no use for me. So, take it slow. Relax and enjoy!

Day 8: December 10, 2019

Today's progress: I felt like I have so many information and I need to group them altogether. That's why I decided to create my own templates. I checked everything I wrote on my notebooks and files on my computer.Then, I found one tutorial about how to design a form, I decided to watch and practice at the same time. I couldn't finish because I don't know some parts.I will finish tomorrow.

Feelings: I wish I had more time to learn especially know, but impossible.I'm doing whatever I can. I will continue to FreeCodeCamp;but I have so many other resources, too. I don't know which way to go. All of them is highly interesting!

Day 13: December 15, 2019

Today's Progress: I finished my Survey Page project and finished CSS Grid and Flexbox parts in FreeCodeCamp. Reviewed animations and transitions.

Today's Progress: I studied on SoloLearn and searched some questions that I didn't quite undertsand. Continued to my project and finished it but I have some problem with my grid and images.

Feelings: I can focus for longer hours while coding now. I need to plan before coding. Every part of the project got messed up becuase I didn't group them before hand. But, I'm learning everyday, this should make it better.

I will try to fix that tomorrow. Then, I did challenge with logical questions, I learned so many new terms and HTML tags, it was informative. Then, I started to learn about Skeleton and started my last project. I found a very good course.I'm following that course, too. And, I finished one project about navigation bars with a video.

Feelings: I am feeling so happy actually, I wish I could discover this area before going to university. I never had any chance to see such websites before. This year I learned so many things and all by myself. This is incredible. I think school didn't teach me anything and I am really sad about that.

Day 19: December 22, 2019

Today's Progress: I continued on my last project. Portfolio page, styling is really making me stressful. I see that there are better options than using CSS. I want to learn other frameworks and and Adobe products to make it better the style. But, I got my certificate anyway. I'm happy that I finished; but I will keep coming back again.In this 20 days almost, I got so many certificates and different resources, it's amazing, I will share my certificates from Lynda, Sololearn and FreeCodeCamp.

Feelings: I'm happy but I haven't mastered everything yet; I listened to traversymedia and he also said we don't need to be a master in CSS before moving onto JS. That's why I will continue to learn different stuff, it is necessary to learn and combine different languages or programs.

Today's Progress: I'm studying JavaScript basics on FreeCodeCamp, SoloLearn and The Odin Project. I hope I will learn very well and it will be not so hard.

Feelings: I am so sleepy and lazy these days. It is so hard to open my eyes sometimes, I'm fasting or maybe my sleeping pattern changed a lot. They can cause this and I am waking up early without sleeping enough. I don't know what to do. Let's see.

Today's Progress: I managed to study on freeCodeCamp, finished almost half of the JavaScript challenges and did a little SoloLearn. Also, continued with Lynda course.

Day 25 : December 28, 2019

Today's Progress: I searched through all the bookmarks that I had before, and checked out the websites. I decided to take FrontEnd Masters courses, I started with Web Development and git by Brian Holt; after that I continued with Kyle Simpson's javaScript course. Tomorrow I will continue.

Feelings: These days I am feeling so distracted; that's why I searched through what I can do. First, I found a Coursera course about how to study and I will take that course when it is accepted. The, I listened to "Getting Things Done". I understood my problem and I will use the strategies like instructed in the video. It looks so effective. I am planning to be more organized. I need to work systematically and I should have a schedule including every hour and everyday. 

Day 26 : December 29, 2019

Today's Progress : I started with lynda course and learnt functions and closures. It took me a while. I did some FreeCodeCamp and 3/4 finished.

Feelings: I decided to manage my time and focus better. I am gonna check myself when I lose track of what I am doing. I am feeling motivated for new year.

Day 27 : December 30, 2019

Today's Progress : I tried to use CodeAcademy, it was looking good; but I checked the comments and I experienced also that their course system is not organized. Then I continued with lynda course. Learning about DOM, query selectors and elements.

Feelings: I'm having some mental issues; I'm trying to push myself; but my brain is making me so hopeless. I want to achieve something; but there is always something in my brain telling me "No, you cannot do that!". I'm trying to motivate myself and learning about time and focus management; I am feeling so sleepy suddenly while studying or I'm getting distracted easily. I asked to my boyfriend about this. He is always motivated when he wants to do something and he told me that I learned so many things in this whole year and it's better to compare myself with the year before.I think he is right, I want to be like those people who are getting jobs and being a master in everything; but I am not seeing my progress. Ok, I will read motivational posts but I will try not to compare myself with others. In this new year, I am planning to learn and feeling good about it not thinking about other people's progress; but only mine.

Feelings: I felt so alone today, it's the last day of 2019 and I am alone. However, I searched about Udacity free courses and scholarships and Coursera courses. I applied to them. It took some of my time. I felt a little sleepy again but I didn't sleep; but I could use my time wisely. 

Day 29 : January 1, 2020

Today's Progress: I studied about how to write inline CSS with JavaScript and how to combine DOM elements. After that, I studied on FreeCodeCamp and udacity.

I did some freeCodeCamp; but information didn't sink in, I will read books and follow watchandcode. I also found MIT and Harvard courses; they really look good and comprehensive.

Feelings: I am noticing that I need to know more than programming. I need to go inside the computer structure and how it is working.

Feelings: I am still trying to finish the courses, I will try to finish at least some of them. All of them is very good; I'm feeling stuck. I need to continue with ES6 on freecodecamp; but I will revise the topics first.

Day 36: January 8, 2020

Today's Progress: I started to learn about ES6 and and functional programming.

Feelings: I didn't feel good today, I was distracted so much.

Day 37: January 9, 2020
