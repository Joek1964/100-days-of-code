# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Conor O'Mara

### Day 1: November 10, 2019


**Today's Progress**: Built first solution to Kaggle titanic competition using Logistic Regression. Score = 48%

**Thoughts:** Did basic data prep, made dummies, one hot encoded. Then deployed a basic model with no optimisation or customisation.


### Day 2: November 11, 2019


**Today's Progress**: Added more to the data prep pipeline with imputation of missing data for "Fare" column. Added RandomForestClassifier and submitted solution. Score 74%

**Thoughts**: Trying to work on visualisations and understanding by using Seaborn to see insights before running model.

**Link(s) to work**: [Titanic Repo](https://github.com/comaraDOTcom/kaggle-titanic)

**Reading Material**:
1.  [Titanic stacking & ensemble kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/nicapotato/titanic-voting-pipeline-stack-and-guide)
2.  [Making a website on Github pages using Jekyll](https://pages.github.com/)

### Day 3: November 13, 2019


**Today's Progress**: Read through some Titanic discussions on Kaggle and answered a two questions. Displaying correlations and function to populate age off titles.

**Thoughts**: Survival seems to be mainly correlated with women, embarking at C and fare. Working on displaying these relationships before modelling (SHOULD INFORM FEATURE ENGINEERING DECISIONS)

**Reading Material**:
1.  [Got stuck reading about iterators HERE](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html?)
2.  [Using re.split to retrieve person's title in one function, currently have very clunky way of doing it using .split() twice.](https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html)

### Day 4: November 18, 2019


**Today's Progress**: Learning from a notebook on Stacking models, building a wrapper for Sklearn functions. Also some good ideas on feature engineering and visualisations.

**Thoughts**: Object oriented programming - work on basics.

**Reading Material**:
1.  [Notebook on Stacking](https://www.kaggle.com/arthurtok/introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python)
