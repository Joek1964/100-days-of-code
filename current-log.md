# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## ATTEMPT #5 AT STRICTLY PLAYING #100DaysOfCode

### Day 1 (12/28/20)

**Today's Progress**: Restarted my challenge. Did some FreeCodeCamp. Restructured my repo files and added old files from my previous attempts. 

**Thoughts** Some blogs mention how it's sometimes okay to go lax on the challenge rules, but I'm genuinely curious as to if I can follow this challenge by the book. Besides, it not like I'm deleting the work of my previous attempts. 

I can't necessarily write my own unit tests on HTML (at least not yet), but I been doing my best at following TDD principles where I can. I run my code through a validator to make sure it has correct syntax, and make the effort to do red/green/refractor with each individual test on the site. It's definitely showing a change: my code for each individual submission is a lot smaller and specific for each challenge than it would be if I had just used the same file to submit all my stuff. 

Might touch my Klotski or SC2 game tomorrow. I'm not sure yet. I'm having a lot of fun with freeCodeCamp so far.

### Day 2 (12/29/20)

**Today's Progress**: Continued through freeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts** I'm going slow, but holy crap, my "excessive testing" is making my production code so much cleaner. I've even started putting the documentation for the requirements in their own separate file, since I saw it could end up affecting the validation of tests (and production code is meant to have only what is necessary). I might even revisit and clean up yesterday's code tomorrow.

I had so much fun coding today and taking my mind off of things. Slowly getting more and more comfortable.
