Day 03
June 30, 2020

Today's Progress: Got my react project working on my laptop.  Explored how to use NextJS and the Semantic UI React Library.  

Thoughts: Looks very powerful, can't wait to start building.  I always feel like when I install new stuff, it won't work.  But, with a couple of minor issues, it did.  I love that the code is hot-loaded out of the box, so that I save my file and the browser shows the update.

Day 02
June 30, 2020

Today's Progress: Watched the intro to my udemy course. Downloaded React and javascript docs that described key principles of both.  Also reviewed articles on promises and closures.  

Thoughts: Time flew and it seems like I already have everything installed that I need to be installed.  I'm glad that I started a new public coding challenge, it really did make a difference.  Crazy how that works, and I only hope that I have the energy to make it far enough into it to carry me through.


Day 01
June XX, 2020

Today's Progress: Set some coding goals, including learning the MERN stack.  Watched a REACT hooks pair-programming session on Twitch.TV.

Thoughts: It's been kind of a long layoff.  But I'm ready to commit to coding for the next 100 days.  I feel like I'm in a good position to make material progress on my project.
