Day 09
September 19, 2019

Today's Progress: Started looking at my old Python code and worked on a design for my new code.

Thoughts: I want to move faster and make more progress, but it's clear I need to learn Python first, which takes time.

Day 08
September 18, 2019

Today's Progress: Design Python app for csv file and did some Stack Overflow research to implement.

Thoughts: Great that I was able to schedule it, execute it, and do it early in the morning while I was still fresh.  Need to do that every day.

Day 5-7
September 17, 2019

Today's Progress: Data ingest and design of a couple of different things, one for my node.js workflow and one in Python for work.

Thoughts: Still not committing to really do the coding.  I need to lean into this.

Day 03, 04
September 14, 2019

Today's Progress: Designed a new workflow component for my glitch app, to view interesting deals so that I can start gathering relevant content for topic model development.

Thoughts: I feel like the thing to do is to get back into coding, build this next step in the workflow, and build a corpus.  Then it will be time to dive head first into topic modeling in Python.

Day 02
September 12, 2019

Today's Progress: Played around with my code and watched Andrew NG interview of Jeremy Hinton.  

Thoughts: Made me kind of itchy to get out of the theoretical and start building topic models and structured response models.  I want to do some coding.

Day 01
September 11, 2019

Today's Progress: Used my fbo-scorecard to ingest daily FBO files for the last four months.  Also reviewed some opportunities oer the most recent week.

Thoughts: It feels good to be up early and working with my coding tool again.  I am feeling excited and energized to make this a daily habit and to commit my early morning time to it.  I think I'm on the brink of making something really useful.  Just keep moving forward, an hour at a time.  And find someone to review (maybe Canute?).
