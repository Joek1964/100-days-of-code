Today's Progress: Set some coding goals, including learning the MERN stack.  Watched a REACT hooks pair-programming session on Twitch.TV.

Thoughts: It's been kind of a long layoff.  But I'm ready to commit to coding for the next 100 days.  I feel like I'm in a good position to make material progress on my project.
