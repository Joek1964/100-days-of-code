Today's Progress: Designed a new workflow component for my glitch app, to view interesting deals so that I can start gathering relevant content for topic model development.

Thoughts: I feel like the thing to do is to get back into coding, build this next step in the workflow, and build a corpus.  Then it will be time to dive head first into topic modeling in Python.

Day 02
September 12, 2019

Today's Progress: Played around with my code and watched Andrew NG interview of Jeremy Hinton.  

Thoughts: Made me kind of itchy to get out of the theoretical and start building topic models and structured response models.  I want to do some coding.

Day 01
September 11, 2019

Today's Progress: Used my fbo-scorecard to ingest daily FBO files for the last four months.  Also reviewed some opportunities oer the most recent week.

Thoughts: It feels good to be up early and working with my coding tool again.  I am feeling excited and energized to make this a daily habit and to commit my early morning time to it.  I think I'm on the brink of making something really useful.  Just keep moving forward, an hour at a time.  And find someone to review (maybe Canute?).
