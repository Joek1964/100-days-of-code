**Today's Progress:** Committed to the challenge today. Read the basics of Html such as text, tables, forms, links, images, videos and audios.

**Resources:**-Html & Css: Design and Build Websites by Jon Duckett

**Links to work:** (NIL)

**Thoughts:** It felt good coming back. Tried learning web development a while back but unfortunately fell off the ride.

### Day 7: November.14 Thursday, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Had a busy day, since I'll be beginning my End-of-Semester exams on Monday. Managed to read about
Literal and object constructor notations, Arrays, Built-in javascript objects such as the Browser Object Model, Document Object Model and various Global Objects such as String, Number among others.
Unlike in Java, Functions differ from Methods in JavaScript. Hahah wow!

**Resources:** JavaScript and jQuery by Jon Duckett

**Thoughts:** I should be getting more practical than theoretical. Setting up my github profile mainly for that.
