Day 02
January 31, 2019

Today's Progress: Got handlebars working in my code, and added basic template code plus all the code to render the routes to the various parts of my deal scorecard.

Thoughts: So excited to get the handlebars code working in Glitch.  Was much easier than I expected.  Can't wait to keep going - Bootstrap is next.  I'm rusty at it but am excited to pick it back up now that I have a good use for it.  Definitely feeling like this code is part of my real deal scorecard app.

Day 01
January 30, 2019

Today's Progress: Added middleware routes to my code.  Tested them and they work.  Also started round 3 so set up this log file.

Thoughts: Had a little trouble with Glitch, couldn't load it for a while.  But got my code updated and tested.  Successful day, and I'm documenting in case this is all I do, but feeling excited and motivated, may try to install handlebars tonight.  Also, how cool is it that I have a link to work that doesn't say N/A.  I'm building not taking tutorials, feels great.
