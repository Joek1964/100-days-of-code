Today's Progress: 

Thoughts: 

Link to work: N/A

Day 01
January 30, 2019

Today's Progress: Added middleware routes to my code.  Tested them and they work.  Also started round 3 so set up this log file.

Thoughts: Had a little trouble with Glitch, couldn't load it for a while.  But got my code updated and tested.  Successful day, and I'm documenting in case this is all I do, but feeling excited and motivated, may try to install handlebars tonight.  Also, how cool is it that I have a link to work that doesn't say N/A.  I'm building not taking tutorials, feels great.
