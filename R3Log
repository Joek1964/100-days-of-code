Day 19
February 18, 2019

Today's Progress: Got all of my old PRESOL, SRCSGT, and COMBINE data into MongoDB.  Pulled new data from FBO, processed it, and added it to the MongoDB records.  

Thoughts: Now to create a daily update page, and then a deal scoring page.  I also need to clean up my file storage (and the node.js code) in GitHub.

Day 18
February 16, 2019

Today's Progress: Figured out how to write out one PRESOL record to MongoDB

Thoughts: That is a huge milestone. Getting my data accessible in MongoDB and usable in Glitch is a critical skill for a full stack developer.

Day 13-17
February 15, 2019

Today's Progress: Slowly reconnecting after a crazy work and travel schedule.  Haven't coded for several days but getting back to where I understand where I am and what I need to do next.

Thoughts: I would love to spend several hours tomorrow.  Can't make up all the time I lost in one day but I can definitely make progress.  And I've been making lots of giant steps when I work on this stuff.

Today's Progress: Attended a meetup.  AI discussion on mixup: Beyond Empirical Risk Minimization.  

Thoughts: Still haven't been able to get to coding.

Day 11
February 08, 09, 2019

Today's Progress: Didn't have time to code but was able to spend some time reading AI white papers.

Thoughts: Need to get back to coding before I lose momentum

Day 09
February 06, 07, 2019

Today's Progress: Designed my approach to ingesting managing my input data in my MongoDB environment.

Thoughts: I did this in the car yesterday on the way up to VA.  I wasn't able to write anything down but it helped to think trhough what I was doing.

Day 07
February 05, 2019

Today's Progress: Got records posted to MongoDB (yesterday), and read JSON files from GitHub repo.  So now I can kind of get my data into my app, and then store it in MongoDB

Thoughts:   More work to go to get my data populated, then figure out the best way to update daily with each new file.

Day 06
February 04, 2019

Today's Progress: Built HTML forms in Glitch using Bootstrap, validated inputs, put values entered from forms into object variables.

Thoughts: Good progress.  Next comes storing them in the MongoDB database, which is the real milestone.

Day 05
February 03, 2019

Today's Progress: Attended an AI meetup on reviewing technical papers.  Read two papers, one on reading papers, one on using pre-created datasets for NLP.  At silks, defined my schemas for my FBO data types, and did some coding of drop-down menus. 

Thoughts: Good progress today.  I really need to start developing my UI design for my app.  It's becoming critical to keep up with the things that the tutorial is doing.  Need to sketch out some interface components.

Day 04
February 02, 2019

Today's Progress: Added a ton to my application framework.  Added Bootstrap and created a nav bar.  Created partials in Handlebars to plug in partial web pages into master web page format.  Added dev and prod MongoDB databases.  Connected to the Dev database, including connection validation and error trapping on failure.  Created and instantiated a schema.  Used Glitch env feature to create variables to hide my DB credentials.  Fully backed up to GitHub with a pull request, including commit comment.  So productive and the code worked perfectly.  I even had some MongoDB warning messages come up, and I was able to remove them by following the instructions and adding code.

Thoughts: Hugely productive day, and it's so exciting to be building my actual app.  I've really used the tutorial to build my application, rather than building the tutorial app.  It's been fantastic so far.  All my code has worked, and I'm building my real opportunity app.  I love it.  Step by step, I'm creating what I need as I learn.

Day 03
February 01, 2019

Today's Progress: Didn't have a chance to code, but I did some reading research, and thinking about my code.

Thoughts: I had a very full day, with work, exercise, helping my kids study, date night, and other things that popped up during the day.  But I accomplished so much, not coding was a deliberate choice because I knew I'd do multiple hours over the weekend.

Day 02
January 31, 2019

Today's Progress: Got handlebars working in my code, and added basic template code plus all the code to render the routes to the various parts of my deal scorecard.

Thoughts: So excited to get the handlebars code working in Glitch.  Was much easier than I expected.  Can't wait to keep going - Bootstrap is next.  I'm rusty at it but am excited to pick it back up now that I have a good use for it.  Definitely feeling like this code is part of my real deal scorecard app.

Day 01
January 30, 2019

Today's Progress: Added middleware routes to my code.  Tested them and they work.  Also started round 3 so set up this log file.

Thoughts: Had a little trouble with Glitch, couldn't load it for a while.  But got my code updated and tested.  Successful day, and I'm documenting in case this is all I do, but feeling excited and motivated, may try to install handlebars tonight.  Also, how cool is it that I have a link to work that doesn't say N/A.  I'm building not taking tutorials, feels great.
