**Log**

**R2D1 - April 19th, 2019**
For these past few days have been learning some stuff about HTML and CSS without using libraries. Today I decided to keep on advancing the Free Code Camp curriculum and created the Technical Documentation Page, may style it a bit more in the future, maybe not. Check it out here: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/techdoc/index

**R2D2 - April 20th, 2019**
I have been waiting for this day since I started. The R2D2 day, it's finally here. Continued improving my Front End skills with CSS and today I made my first contribution to an opensource project. Hope the guys at w3develops like what I did and merge my changes. Fingers crossed.

**R2D3 - April 21st, 2019**
Noticed that there was something I left out on the pull request I pushed to the guys at w3develops, today I corrected it and pushed it again. Then kept advancing on the HTML/CSS/Sass course I'm taking at Udemy. Worked a little on the first project of the site.

**R2D4 - April 22nd, 2019**
Ok, I've decided that for this round, I'll focus entirely on finishing the Modern HTML & CSS From The Beginning (Including Sass) course on Udemy. Today I worked a bit more on the first project of that course. I certainly enjoy working on UI/UX

**R2D5 - April 23rd, 2019**
Finished the first project of the Modern HTML & CSS From The Beginning (Including Sass) course, I have not made it responsive yet, but that's what the next part of the course will cover. Hmmm, maybe I'll go ahead and do that myself first, before watching the rest of the chapter.

**R2D6, R2D7, April 27th, 2019**
Have learned a few things about CSS that I hadn't seen covered anywhere else. And got a better understanding of how em and rem units work.

**R2D8, April 28th, 2019**
Finished with the chapter about making things Responsive using CSS on the Model HTML & CSS From The Beginning (Including Sass) Udemy course, and just started a chapter about Flexbox. So many ideas pouring into my head right now, don't even know where to start. Gotta stay focused.

**R2D9, R2D10, April 29th, May 1st, 2019**
I have been working on a Technical Documentation site that's going to be used in my department to train the new recruits for these past few days, and today I watched two videos of the HTML & CSS course.

**R2D11, R2D12, May 2nd, May 4th, 2019**
Not much going on, just practicing my HTML and CSS, got into an issue that I couldn't solve with a fixed top navbar, a body with a padding, and the navigation sidebar with hashed links, that kept wrecking my layout, couldn't solve it, working on it.

**R2D13, May 5th, 2019**
More HTML and CSS practice.

**R2D14, May 5th, 2019**
Still working on the HTML & CSS project of the Udemy course I'm currently taking. This is how the page looks right now: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/edgeledger/ Learned how to add a map using Google's API

**R2D15, May 9th, 2019**
* Added smooth scrolling
* Made site responsive
* Fixed some issues with showcase

**R2D16, May 10th, 2019**
I fixed the issue with the documentation site at work, the problem was caused because the margin I added to the top to clear the navbar, was pushing the content down, so I had to add some padding at the bottom of the content of the same amount as the margin, and that pushed it back up. Also fixed an issue with the Google Map not displaying on mobile screens on the EdgeLedger site

**R2D17, May 23rd, 2019**
It's been almost two weeks since the last time I updated this, I have not stopped tinkering around with HTML and CSS but have done nothing major worth updating here anyways. Truth is that I have been kind of down, but even if I don't post I won't stop making progress.

**R2D1 and R2D2, October 3rd-4th, 2019**
Restarted the Second Round of the 100 Days of Code Challenge since I had stopped at May 23rd of this year and haven't posted since then. Last time I managed to go 17 days into the second round, now I gotta finish it this time. I'll also try to keep advancing my Game Development course since creating games was what got me started into programming in the first place and it's always been a dream of mine. Meanwhile, I'll keep posting the updates to my WebDev Bootcamp on this file. I'm feeling really excited right now about getting back on track. Now I'm learning about basic JavaScript concepts. I had stopped the course but now I'm at unit 9.

**R2D3, October 5th, 2019**
Had some fun with boolean operators in JavaScript and a fun little HTML page to display the results. Got totally sidetracked from today's lesson but I just wanted to see if I was able to do it.
