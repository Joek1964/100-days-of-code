**The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [April 19th, Friday, 2019].**

**Log**

**R2D1 - April 19th, 2019**
For these past few days have been learning some stuff about HTML and CSS without using libraries. Today I decided to keep on advancing the Free Code Camp curriculum and created the Technical Documentation Page, may style it a bit more in the future, maybe not. Check it out here: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/techdoc/index

**R2D2 - April 20th, 2019**
I have been waiting for this day since I started. The R2D2 day, it's finally here. Continued improving my Front End skills with CSS and today I made my first contribution to an opensource project. Hope the guys at w3develops like what I did and merge my changes. Fingers crossed.

**R2D3 - April 21st, 2019**
Noticed that there was something I left out on the pull request I pushed to the guys at w3develops, today I corrected it and pushed it again. Then kept advancing on the HTML/CSS/Sass course I'm taking at Udemy. Worked a little on the first project of the site.

**R2D4 - April 22nd, 2019**
Ok, I've decided that for this round, I'll focus entirely on finishing the Modern HTML & CSS From The Beginning (Including Sass) course on Udemy. Today I worked a bit more on the first project of that course. I certainly enjoy working on UI/UX

**R2D5 - April 23rd, 2019**
Finished the first project of the Modern HTML & CSS From The Beginning (Including Sass) course, I have not made it responsive yet, but that's what the next part of the course will cover. Hmmm, maybe I'll go ahead and do that myself first, before watching the rest of the chapter.

**R2D6, R2D7, April 27th, 2019**
Have learned a few things about CSS that I hadn't seen covered anywhere else. And got a better understanding of how em and rem units work.

**R2D8, April 28th, 2019**
Finished with the chapter about making things Responsive using CSS on the Model HTML & CSS From The Beginning (Including Sass) Udemy course, and just started a chapter about Flexbox. So many ideas pouring into my head right now, don't even know where to start. Gotta stay focused.

**R2D9, R2D10, April 29th, May 1st, 2019**
I have been working on a Technical Documentation site that's going to be used in my department to train the new recruits for these past few days, and today I watched two videos of the HTML & CSS course.

**R2D11, R2D12, May 2nd, May 4th, 2019**
Not much going on, just practicing my HTML and CSS, got into an issue that I couldn't solve with a fixed top navbar, a body with a padding, and the navigation sidebar with hashed links, that kept wrecking my layout, couldn't solve it, working on it.

**R2D13, May 5th, 2019**
More HTML and CSS practice.

**R2D14, May 5th, 2019**
Still working on the HTML & CSS project of the Udemy course I'm currently taking. This is how the page looks right now: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/edgeledger/ Learned how to add a map using Google's API

**R2D15, May 9th, 2019**
* Added smooth scrolling
* Made site responsive
* Fixed some issues with showcase

**R2D16, May 10th, 2019**
I fixed the issue with the documentation site at work, the problem was caused because the margin I added to the top to clear the navbar, was pushing the content down, so I had to add some padding at the bottom of the content of the same amount as the margin, and that pushed it back up. Also fixed an issue with the Google Map not displaying on mobile screens on the EdgeLedger site

**R2D17, May 23rd, 2019**
It's been almost two weeks since the last time I updated this, I have not stopped tinkering around with HTML and CSS but have done nothing major worth updating here anyways. Truth is that I have been kind of down, but even if I don't post I won't stop making progress.

**R2D1 and R2D2, October 3rd-4th, 2019**
Restarted the Second Round of the 100 Days of Code Challenge since I had stopped at May 23rd of this year and haven't posted since then. Last time I managed to go 17 days into the second round, now I gotta finish it this time. I'll also try to keep advancing my Game Development course since creating games was what got me started into programming in the first place and it's always been a dream of mine. Meanwhile, I'll keep posting the updates to my WebDev Bootcamp on this file. I'm feeling really excited right now about getting back on track. Now I'm learning about basic JavaScript concepts. I had stopped the course but now I'm at unit 9.

**R2D3, October 5th, 2019**
Had some fun with boolean operators in JavaScript and a fun little HTML page to display the results. Got totally sidetracked from today's lesson but I just wanted to see if I was able to do it.

**R2D4, October 6th, 2019**
Fooled around a bit more with JavaScript's boolean operators. Really getting hooked on practicing once again. I'm really enjoying this.

**R2D5-6, October 7th-8th, 2019**
Finished Section 9 of the WebDev Bootcamp and got through most of Section 10. Wasting time is becoming harder, even though staying focused is even harder. At least I stop myself from procrastinating too much and am able to stay on track for longer periods of time.

**R2D7, October 9th, 2019**
Well, actually realized I was not in Unit 9 of the course but Unit 12, and I already finished it and started Unit 13. Can't wait to get to the good stuff since right now we're just touching basic concepts. But I know I have to be patient.

**R2D8-9, October 10th-11th, 2019**
Advancing through Unit 13 of the Web Dev Bootcamp, learning about handling Arrays in JavaScript, made a simple TODO list. Almost halfway through until I get to OOP in JS

**R2D10, October 14th, 2019**
Kept learning about handling arrays in JavaScript. Practiced today how to use Array.forEach() and learned about using Array.splice() to remove elements from the array using an index, which I didn't know about. Thinking about improving my TODO page that's on my portfolio.

**R2D11, October 16th, 2019**
Done with Unit 13 and now started Unit 14, an introduction to Object in JavaScript, really excited by this and then it's on to DOM manipulation.

**R2D12, October 22nd, 2019**
Got through Unit 14 of the Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy. Object manipulation in JavaScript is a little bit different than what I'm familiar with. Now on to Unit 15 where I'll learn about DOM manipulation. And also started working on a project that I've always wanted to make.

**R2D13, R2D14, R2D15, October 28th, 2019**
Not completely sure if it's been three or four days, but I'm gonna assume it's been only three. I finished Section 15 of the Web Dev course and finished with the basics of DOM manipulation. Now it's on to Section 16 to learn about advanced DOM manipulation, which is where I stopped the course last time on 2018

**R2D16, R2D17, October 29th and October 30th, 2019**
Finished with Section 16 of the Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy about advanced DOM manipulation. Did some fun projects and learned about separation of concerns between the styles, the structure and the programming logic behind it all. I'm pretty excited to be starting Section 17. In the mean time, I used what I learned from these lessons and updated my TODO List, now you can Add a new entry to the TODO list, and it is added with a cool little animation, but you can also remove the entries by right clicking on them, they fade away graciously with another neat little animation. Check it out: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/todolist/html/index

**R2D18, R2D19, R2D20, October 31st, November 1st, November 2nd, 2019**
I have been learning about class creation in JavaScript, it's kind of confusing since I'm used to how it is done in C++, Java and C#, but JavaScript is a Prototypal language so there's no such thing as "Classes" in the classical sense. Also I'm almost finished with unit 17 of the course, gonna finish it tomorrow since I'm tired for today

**R2D21, November 5, 2019**
Finished the color guessing game project. I'm feeling really excited about the course and I'm really looking forward to keep digging into how JavaScript handles OOP. Now I'm starting unit 18, which is an intro to jQuery. Here's the link to the game: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/colorgame/

**R2D1, July 4, 2020**
Restarting 100 days of code challenge for the second round. I decided that I'm going to dedicate two hours each day to this challenge to advance my Modern HTML & CSS From the Beginning course on Udemy. If I keep my pace right, I will be able to finish it in 10 days. I also decided to restart the course from scratch, since it's been so long since I last coded something that I've forgotten most of it. Lately I've been assessing what motivates me and keeps me going with this stuff and I have come to realize that getting myself organized with a set schedule to do things helps me in seeing how far I have advanced, and pushes me to keep going. I have come to understand that I won't do stuff just because I have to do it, nor without following a set constraint for myself, be it with my Gym routine, or even for learning to coding. I will try to also learn JavaScript along with the material of this course and then I will see from there. Today I managed to do only three Pomodoros instead of the four I proposed myself on achieving each day. But I don't really mind. I am going to take advantage of the time I have available. Lately I have not been doing much because I have felt down for some reason and unmotivated, but I hope that by sticking to my set routine I will be able to do the things I want to do.
