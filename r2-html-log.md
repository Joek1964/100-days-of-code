**Log**

**R2D1 - April 19th, 2019**
For these past few days have been learning some stuff about HTML and CSS without using libraries. Today I decided to keep on advancing the Free Code Camp curriculum and created the Technical Documentation Page, may style it a bit more in the future, maybe not. Check it out here: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/techdoc/index

**R2D2 - April 20th, 2019**
I have been waiting for this day since I started. The R2D2 day, it's finally here. Continued improving my Front End skills with CSS and today I made my first contribution to an opensource project. Hope the guys at w3develops like what I did and merge my changes. Fingers crossed.

**R2D3 - April 21st, 2019**
Noticed that there was something I left out on the pull request I pushed to the guys at w3develops, today I corrected it and pushed it again. Then kept advancing on the HTML/CSS/Sass course I'm taking at Udemy. Worked a little on the first project of the site.

**R2D4 - April 22nd, 2019**
Ok, I've decided that for this round, I'll focus entirely on finishing the Modern HTML & CSS From The Beginning (Including Sass) course on Udemy. Today I worked a bit more on the first project of that course. I certainly enjoy working on UI/UX

**R2D5 - April 23rd, 2019**
Finished the first project of the Modern HTML & CSS From The Beginning (Including Sass) course, I have not made it responsive yet, but that's what the next part of the course will cover. Hmmm, maybe I'll go ahead and do that myself first, before watching the rest of the chapter.

**R2D6, R2D7, April 27th, 2019**
Have learned a few things about CSS that I hadn't seen covered anywhere else. And got a better understanding of how em and rem units work.

**R2D8, April 28th, 2019**
Finished with the chapter about making things Responsive using CSS on the Model HTML & CSS From The Beginning (Including Sass) Udemy course, and just started a chapter about Flexbox. So many ideas pouring into my head right now, don't even know where to start. Gotta stay focused.

**R2D9, R2D10, April 29th, May 1st, 2019**
I have been working on a Technical Documentation site that's going to be used in my department to train the new recruits for these past few days, and today I watched two videos of the HTML & CSS course.

**R2D11, R2D12, May 2nd, May 4th, 2019**
Not much going on, just practicing my HTML and CSS, got into an issue that I couldn't solve with a fixed top navbar, a body with a padding, and the navigation sidebar with hashed links, that kept wrecking my layout, couldn't solve it, working on it.

**R2D13, May 5th, 2019**
More HTML and CSS practice.

**R2D14, May 5th, 2019**
Still working on the HTML & CSS project of the Udemy course I'm currently taking. This is how the page looks right now: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/edgeledger/ Learned how to add a map using Google's API

**R2D15, May 9th, 2019**
* Added smooth scrolling
