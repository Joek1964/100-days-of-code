**#100DaysOfCode Log - Round 2 - Anubis Lockward**
**The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [April 19th, Friday, 2019].**

**Log**

**R2D1 - April 19th, 2019**
For these past few days have been learning some stuff about HTML and CSS without using libraries. Today I decided to keep on advancing the Free Code Camp curriculum and created the Technical Documentation Page, may style it a bit more in the future, maybe not. Check it out here: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/techdoc/index

**R2D2 - April 20th, 2019**
I have been waiting for this day since I started. The R2D2 day, it's finally here. Continued improving my Front End skills with CSS and today I made my first contribution to an opensource project. Hope the guys at w3develops like what I did and merge my changes. Fingers crossed.

**R2D3 - April 21st, 2019**
Noticed that there was something I left out on the pull request I pushed to the guys at w3develops, today I corrected it and pushed it again. Then kept advancing on the HTML/CSS/Sass course I'm taking at Udemy. Worked a little on the first project of the site.

**R2D4 - April 22nd, 2019**
Ok, I've decided that for this round, I'll focus entirely on finishing the Modern HTML & CSS From The Beginning (Including Sass) course on Udemy. Today I worked a bit more on the first project of that course. I certainly enjoy working on UI/UX

**R2D5 - April 23rd, 2019**
Finished the first project of the Modern HTML & CSS From The Beginning (Including Sass) course, I have not made it responsive yet, but that's what the next part of the course will cover. Hmmm, maybe I'll go ahead and do that myself first, before watching the rest of the chapter.

**R2D6, R2D7, April 27th, 2019**
Have learned a few things about CSS that I hadn't seen covered anywhere else. And got a better understanding of how em and rem units work.

**R2D8, April 28th, 2019**
Finished with the chapter about making things Responsive using CSS on the Model HTML & CSS From The Beginning (Including Sass) Udemy course, and just started a chapter about Flexbox. So many ideas pouring into my head right now, don't even know where to start. Gotta stay focused.

**R2D9, R2D10, April 29th, May 1st, 2019**
I have been working on a Technical Documentation site that's going to be used in my department to train the new recruits for these past few days, and today I watched two videos of the HTML & CSS course.

**R2D11, R2D12, May 2nd, May 4th, 2019**
Not much going on, just practicing my HTML and CSS, got into an issue that I couldn't solve with a fixed top navbar, a body with a padding, and the navigation sidebar with hashed links, that kept wrecking my layout, couldn't solve it, working on it.

**R2D13, May 5th, 2019**
More HTML and CSS practice.

**R2D14, May 5th, 2019**
Still working on the HTML & CSS project of the Udemy course I'm currently taking. This is how the page looks right now: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/edgeledger/ Learned how to add a map using Google's API

**R2D15, May 9th, 2019**
* Added smooth scrolling
* Made site responsive
* Fixed some issues with showcase

**R2D16, May 10th, 2019**
I fixed the issue with the documentation site at work, the problem was caused because the margin I added to the top to clear the navbar, was pushing the content down, so I had to add some padding at the bottom of the content of the same amount as the margin, and that pushed it back up. Also fixed an issue with the Google Map not displaying on mobile screens on the EdgeLedger site

**R2D17, May 23rd, 2019**
It's been almost two weeks since the last time I updated this, I have not stopped tinkering around with HTML and CSS but have done nothing major worth updating here anyways. Truth is that I have been kind of down, but even if I don't post I won't stop making progress.

**R2D1 and R2D2, October 3rd-4th, 2019**
Restarted the Second Round of the 100 Days of Code Challenge since I had stopped at May 23rd of this year and haven't posted since then. Last time I managed to go 17 days into the second round, now I gotta finish it this time. I'll also try to keep advancing my Game Development course since creating games was what got me started into programming in the first place and it's always been a dream of mine. Meanwhile, I'll keep posting the updates to my WebDev Bootcamp on this file. I'm feeling really excited right now about getting back on track. Now I'm learning about basic JavaScript concepts. I had stopped the course but now I'm at unit 9.

**R2D3, October 5th, 2019**
Had some fun with boolean operators in JavaScript and a fun little HTML page to display the results. Got totally sidetracked from today's lesson but I just wanted to see if I was able to do it.

**R2D4, October 6th, 2019**
Fooled around a bit more with JavaScript's boolean operators. Really getting hooked on practicing once again. I'm really enjoying this.

**R2D5-6, October 7th-8th, 2019**
Finished Section 9 of the WebDev Bootcamp and got through most of Section 10. Wasting time is becoming harder, even though staying focused is even harder. At least I stop myself from procrastinating too much and am able to stay on track for longer periods of time.

**R2D7, October 9th, 2019**
Well, actually realized I was not in Unit 9 of the course but Unit 12, and I already finished it and started Unit 13. Can't wait to get to the good stuff since right now we're just touching basic concepts. But I know I have to be patient.

**R2D8-9, October 10th-11th, 2019**
Advancing through Unit 13 of the Web Dev Bootcamp, learning about handling Arrays in JavaScript, made a simple TODO list. Almost halfway through until I get to OOP in JS

**R2D10, October 14th, 2019**
Kept learning about handling arrays in JavaScript. Practiced today how to use Array.forEach() and learned about using Array.splice() to remove elements from the array using an index, which I didn't know about. Thinking about improving my TODO page that's on my portfolio.

**R2D11, October 16th, 2019**
Done with Unit 13 and now started Unit 14, an introduction to Object in JavaScript, really excited by this and then it's on to DOM manipulation.

**R2D12, October 22nd, 2019**
Got through Unit 14 of the Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy. Object manipulation in JavaScript is a little bit different than what I'm familiar with. Now on to Unit 15 where I'll learn about DOM manipulation. And also started working on a project that I've always wanted to make.

**R2D13, R2D14, R2D15, October 28th, 2019**
Not completely sure if it's been three or four days, but I'm gonna assume it's been only three. I finished Section 15 of the Web Dev course and finished with the basics of DOM manipulation. Now it's on to Section 16 to learn about advanced DOM manipulation, which is where I stopped the course last time on 2018

**R2D16, R2D17, October 29th and October 30th, 2019**
Finished with Section 16 of the Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy about advanced DOM manipulation. Did some fun projects and learned about separation of concerns between the styles, the structure and the programming logic behind it all. I'm pretty excited to be starting Section 17. In the mean time, I used what I learned from these lessons and updated my TODO List, now you can Add a new entry to the TODO list, and it is added with a cool little animation, but you can also remove the entries by right clicking on them, they fade away graciously with another neat little animation. Check it out: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/todolist/html/index

**R2D18, R2D19, R2D20, October 31st, November 1st, November 2nd, 2019**
I have been learning about class creation in JavaScript, it's kind of confusing since I'm used to how it is done in C++, Java and C#, but JavaScript is a Prototypal language so there's no such thing as "Classes" in the classical sense. Also I'm almost finished with unit 17 of the course, gonna finish it tomorrow since I'm tired for today

**R2D21, November 5, 2019**
Finished the color guessing game project. I'm feeling really excited about the course and I'm really looking forward to keep digging into how JavaScript handles OOP. Now I'm starting unit 18, which is an intro to jQuery. Here's the link to the game: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/colorgame/

**R2D1, July 4, 2020**
Restarting 100 days of code challenge for the second round. I decided that I'm going to dedicate two hours each day to this challenge to advance my Modern HTML & CSS From the Beginning course on Udemy. If I keep my pace right, I will be able to finish it in 10 days. I also decided to restart the course from scratch, since it's been so long since I last coded something that I've forgotten most of it. Lately I've been assessing what motivates me and keeps me going with this stuff and I have come to realize that getting myself organized with a set schedule to do things helps me in seeing how far I have advanced, and pushes me to keep going. I have come to understand that I won't do stuff just because I have to do it, nor without following a set constraint for myself, be it with my Gym routine, or even for learning to coding. I will try to also learn JavaScript along with the material of this course and then I will see from there. Today I managed to do only three Pomodoros instead of the four I proposed myself on achieving each day. But I don't really mind. I am going to take advantage of the time I have available. Lately I have not been doing much because I have felt down for some reason and unmotivated, but I hope that by sticking to my set routine I will be able to do the things I want to do.

**R2D2, July 7, 2020**
Worked a bit on my personal project for the D&D Spell visualizer, and advanced a bit on the Modern HTML course. Doing stuff with List, Tables and Forms. I have to learn how properly create the tables for a Database for the spells to be able to ask the appropriate question to the database and show them on the page. I'm almost finished with the basic introductory parts of HTML, and got a refresher on Block and Inline elements, as well as Divs, Spans, Classes and IDs. Looked at HTML entities and got a bit of an idea for an old project that I worked with a long time ago for a game. Maybe I'll try it out with that too, it uses the symbols for card sets. I arrived at the part for Semantic Tags and it seems that there's going to be some sort of challenge for that part. I'll work on it tomorrow.

**R2D3, August 1st, 2020**
I have been learning a bit of JavaScript and did a basic introduction on NodeJS. And finished the Section 2 on HTML Basics on the Modern HTML & CSS From the Beginning course on Udemy. I have been struggling with sticking to doing this frequently since I have not been doing the Pomodoros like I should. Have been beating myself over it quite a lot too, and each time I think that I'm failing that's how I really feel instead of feeling like I'm advancing. So I should also focus on avoiding that. I also managed to create a simple website in HTML that allows me to register phone numbers by using a couple inputs and a table, and I managed to get it to work with plain JavaScript, the code ended up being a completely awful mess but I managed to do the majority of it without having to do much googling around. The site doesn't have any CSS right now and the data doesn't persist. So I'll get to work in that as I keep pushing myself to finish the HTML course.

**R2D4, August 2nd, 2020**
I have been learning about how JavaScript handles primitives and Objects, and what their difference are. Learning the difference of using var, let and const, IIFEs, block scope, global and local variables. And Number methods, specifically, parseInt and parseFloat.

**R2D5, August 13th, 2020**
Today, progress was slow, if I can call it progress at all. Had a conversation with my wife telling her about all the things I want to accomplish, and how I am doing nothing at all to do so. I still struggle with how to come up with inspiration for what to do. I talked to her how I feel that I have been acquiring knowledge without any clear goal in mind. My mind is completely blocked, I can't seem to think of any ideas and when I try to do it, nothing comes to mind. Pushing myself beyond this point is one of the hardest things I've done in my life, and yet, every time I manage to break past this point, I bounce back and fall even harder the higher I raise. I know I should stop beating myself over it and stop comparing myself with others, and I even know that most people don't achieve true knowledge, yet I am still certain that I have not accomplished what goals I want to reach. I have many things to keep writing, and even feel like doing so, but at the same time, I see no point in doing it, and I don't want to either.

**R2D6, August 19th, 2020**
Worked a bit on my Phone Book web project today, trying to fix the table's styling and fixing a bug that was caused when I introduced values that were too long and messed up the column's width. Tweaked it a bit using table-layout:fixed in CSS and started working on a way to delete an entry from the list. I also worked on that yesterday but didn't do much. I have to add a way to edit the values on the table too, and then some way to store them, at least temporarily in an array until I get to learn how to store them in a database. I finally got my dual monitor setup working so I think that I'll be working on a more regular basis on getting into the coding habit.

I know I am skipping some posts since the last time I updated my entries for the challenge, and I don't remember exactly when was the last time I posted, but I have kept my log updated locally on my PC, and I'm currently on day 6. 

Motivation has been low these days, lost something along the way and I can't exactly tell what. But I rather keep advancing than standing still on the same place.

I got a dual monitor setup, which kind of inspires me to jump back into coding again, so I'm gonna use that as a crotch for the time being. I worked a bit on a simple project I came up with, trying to make it without googling around too much, and I realized that comparing what I have done with what others seem to be able to do will not get me anywhere, so I'm trying to not actually do that and realize that I don't really know the story behind how they got to where they are, or how they did certain things.

Another thing that demotivates me is that I seem to be only accumulating knowledge without doing anything useful with it, nor exactly knowing what to do with it. How do you even get past that? I feel like I did more when I knew less, but that might be something coming out from pure perception rather than actual reality, since, you know, you have the greatest potential of learning something when you know nothing about it in the first place, but after a certain point, everything you learn seems to mean so little in the grand scheme of things. Or you keep learning new stuff only to realize that there is still so much left to learn. Going back to the basic projects I used to do back when I was starting to learn how to code seems so pointless now, yet, that's what I think I need to do right now to improve at a slow steady pace. It's easier for me to do that in the gym than it is for computer programming, I have become so impatient, and I don't know why. Any advice?

**R2D7, August 20th, 2020**
Asked around on the Discord group for the challenge and someone pointed me to two helpful resources for ideas on projects I should be making. Today I started working on the logic and JavaScript code for a simple Binary to Decimal converter, and I managed to make it work without googling around. Just had to freshen up the logic by watching a Math course on Khan Academy. Noted a few things that I have yet to implement to make the project better and what's this? two post made in two consecutive days?

I know it doesn't seem like much, and that I should be able to do those things already, but my goal here is to get back into the habit of coding, and I am learning JavaScript. So, I am going to take this as I do going back to the gym after a long hiatus, I am going to start back at a newbie level, even when I know that that might be detrimental to my success. Yet I am still taking a leapt of faith and getting back to the beginnings, so that I can make it to the end.

**R2D8, August 22nd, 2020**
I finished the JavaScript project for converting binary numbers to decimals, filling up all the requirements from the project. Now I have to work into making it look nicer since everything is just HTML with barely any CSS in it and have to polish the code up a bit.

**R2D9, August 24th, 2020**
I did a dopamine detox yesterday on August 23rd of 2020 trying to become more productive. I won't say much changed but at least I learned how to motivate myself, why some things don't motivate me, or why some motivate me more than others. I managed to read 100 pages of a book that I had put off for almost two years.
I also did a lot of practice learning about HTML tables and how to style them which is something I also wanted to do for a personal project. But I have yet to finish styling the Binary to Decimal converter though.

I will try to do the dopamine detox at least once a week since when you are a parent with two kids, it's almost impossible to completely avoid some stimuli from reaching you -like when they start singing or listening to music, for example-, all in all, I think it wasn't as bad as I expected it to be, and at least I managed to code for several hours today.

**R2D10, August 31st, 2020**
This week's advancement has been slower than I had desired, but still not fully stopped. I managed to configure WakaTime on VS Code to track how much time I spent on conding. Althought I cannot track in there how much time I spend reading or investigating about how something works, like I have been doing with table elements in HTML for my simple personal project, I spent more than two hours just on that alone today. I have to also finish working on the Binary to Decimal Converter's styling and some other details, but that's on my list of TO-DOs before I set out to work on a third project. I have read about three chapters of the book that I was reading, and did some exercise too.

**R2D11, September 7th, 2020**
Today was one of the most productives days I've had so far. I managed to wake up early, read a few pages of a book, and managed to invest time learning about HTML, styling them and even threw in some JavaScript in there. All in all I spent 2 and a half hours coding, and almost four hours in total doing just that. It's only 10:00 AM and I can even spend the rest of the day leisurely without feeling any regrets. The only thing I'm missing is doing some exercise, let's see if I'm in the mood for that later in the day. I'm loving this day.

**R2D12, September 8th, 2020**
Today I kept learning about some tips and tricks to style HTML Tables, and make some cool effects using JavaScript and CSS. I also managed to code for another 2 and a half hours today.

**R2D13, September 11th, 2020**
Today was a fun day. Instead of trying to keep advancing on the tips and tricks from the Complete Guide to the Table Element, I focused on practicing what I have learned so far. I started tweaking around trying to create a table with editable cells. Ran into some issues with some incorrect padding that was being added between the cell and the input field but I managed to fix it, thought I confess I had to do some googling around the final solution I found it on my own, since none of the results I found solved it. Then practiced styling the table without checking on my previous lessons and with minimal google-fu except for looking at syntax at MDN, and I am very happy with the end result. I practiced for about 2 hours and 50 minutes today.

**R2D14, September 12th, 2020**
Started doing some experiments with styling my simple project using what I have learned so far about HTML tables. Managed to create an element from scratch in JavaScript and improved the styling of the table I was using to show the data. Tested that the new elements being added were appearing with the correct stylings and now I only have to make all new entries editable and implement the functionality for deleting entries.

**R2D15, September 13th, 2020**
Improved the styling of my project a bit more and managed to make all the new entries added to the table editable. Now I only have to implement the delete functionality and a way to store the entries.

**R2D16, September 23rd, 2020**
Kept tweaking a bit more with stylings and managed to implement the JavaScript code for deleting entries from the table, implemented it on a weird fugly way at first, and then a friend told me of a simpler way with Element.closest(). I have finally finished a basic CRUD in a web project which is a first for me. Now I only have to make the data persist in some way, so it might be a good time to start learning how to do it on Node. Althought I want to keep learning JavaScript since my current understanding of it is kind of bogus. Also learned a bit about Math, Number and String in JavaScript, as well as how includes(), trim(), split(), toUpperCase() toLowerCase() and a bunch of other methods work in JavaScript and comparing the similarities it has with Java which is the language I am most familiar with.

**R2D17, September 24th, 2020**
Keep going through the basics of JavaScript, today was templatized strings, and how to create Objects and assign them properties and methods.

**R2D18, September 25th, 2020**
Got an intro into Function Context in JavaScript, how to add properties and methods to objects, and nested objects. And also learned that JSON meant 'Java Script Object Notation'. I have used JSON files before in Java, but never bothered to learn where the format came from. Watched a couple of videos on how JavaScript handles Control Flow statements, and the different logical comparators it uses. Pretty basic stuff, but I'm trying to advance this with baby steps even thought I know how most of these stuff are handled already.

**R2D1, January 5th, 2021**
Finished section 5 of the Web Developer Bootcamp for HTML Forms & Tables. Also practiced replicating some tables found on Wikipedia articles.

**R2D2, January 7th, 2021**
Completed section 6 of the Web Developer Bootcamp 2021, covering the very basics of CSS. Did a couple exercises and practiced a little bit with styling a simple page.

**R2D3, January 10th, 2021**
Went through the Section 7 of the course, refreshing my knowledge about CSS Selectors and practicing a bit with a fun little site. Went through half the lesson.

**R2D4, January 12th, 2021**
Finished Section 7. I Learned a few things about CSS selectors, the difference between Pseudo classes and pseudo elements, and a few things about Specificity. I also saw a few options of the Dev Tools on Google Chrome that I didn't know about. Also I learned that there are certain properties on the elements that are not inherited by default which can be changed by setting that property to 'inherit'

**R2D5, January 16th, 2021**
Started Section 8, which covers the CSS Box Model. Watched a couple of videos explaining some of the properties of the Box Model, like with, height and Border.

**R2D6, January 17th, 2021**
Learned a few things about Borders and box-sizing, made a little practice and then learned about padding.

**R2D7, January 18th, 2021**
Today's videos covered: Margin, Display, the difference between Inline, Block, and Inline-Block elements and how Width, Height, Margin and Padding behave for each of these display properties. Also talked about relative units, like percentages, EMs and REMs. I also learned that line-height is related to the font-size of the element. Now going to start Section 9 and see some useful CSS properties. Also started working on creating a clone for an entry on Wikipedia about Dane axes.

**R2D8, January 19th-20th, 2021**
Started a practice project to create a Wikipedia clone for a particular entry. Added the content and made the summary part of the page look somewhat similar to the one I chose which is about Dane Axese.
