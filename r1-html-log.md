**Log**

**R1D1 - December 6th, 2018**
Completed two Pomodoros on freecodecamp's Applied Visual Design curriculum. This is something I made from a previous example on the basic HTML and CSS part of the course: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/practice.html

**R1D2 - December 7th, 2018**
Kept advancing on the Applied Visual Design challenges on freecodecamp. The published site on GitHub pages should be updating automatically when I push the changes. Here's an improved version of the previous CatPhotoApp with visuals improved a bit: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/practice

**R1D3 - December 8th, 2018**
Did some lessons of the Applied Visual Design challenges on freecodecamp. Confirmed that the published GitHub page for the CatPhotoApp is updating automatically when I push the changes. Here's the current version: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/practice

**R1D4 - December 9th, 2018**
Today I didn't advance on freecodecamp because I decided to start working on my online CV, I've always wanted to make one and I think that it is coming along nicely. Found a way to add collapsible lists using CSS only. Here's the mockup? layout? how do you call this thing? Anyways, here's the link: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/onlinecv/html/index
