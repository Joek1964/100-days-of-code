**#100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Anubis Lockward**
**The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [December 6, Thursday, 2018].**

**Log**

**R1D1 - December 6th, 2018**
Completed two Pomodoros on freecodecamp's Applied Visual Design curriculum. This is something I made from a previous example on the basic HTML and CSS part of the course: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/practice.html

**R1D2 - December 7th, 2018**
Kept advancing on the Applied Visual Design challenges on freecodecamp. The published site on GitHub pages should be updating automatically when I push the changes. Here's an improved version of the previous CatPhotoApp with visuals improved a bit: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/practice

**R1D3 - December 8th, 2018**
Did some lessons of the Applied Visual Design challenges on freecodecamp. Confirmed that the published GitHub page for the CatPhotoApp is updating automatically when I push the changes. Here's the current version: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/practice

**R1D4 - December 9th, 2018**
Today I didn't advance on freecodecamp because I decided to start working on my online CV, I've always wanted to make one and I think that it is coming along nicely. Found a way to add collapsible lists using CSS only. Here's the mockup? layout? how do you call this thing? Anyways, here's the link: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/onlinecv/html/index

**R1D5 - December 10th, 2018**
Added a navbar to the CV to navigate between sections. Added anchors for correct positioning when navigation on the page using the navbar. Also discovered that the css file was not linking correctly to the published page and fixed it.

**R1D6 - December 11th, 2018**
Made the CatPhotoApp look psychedelic with a bunch of colors and crazy animations. Also changed the folder structure for the project. Check it out at the Portfolio website. https://mr2much.github.io/webdev

**R1D7 - December 12th, 2018**
The stars on the CatPhotoApp are now displayed at each side of the "main window" instead of at the top, I was reducing the width of the BODY element, I changed it to reduce the width of the main container instead. Also finished the Applied Visual Design challenges on freecodecamp, going to start the Applied Accessibility Challenges.

**R1D8 - December 13th, 2018**
Did some of the Applied Accessibility Challenges on freecodecamp, and it's finally here, my customized landing page for the online portfolio, tremble world for I am powerful: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/

**R1D9 - December 14th, 2018**
Did two pomodoros for the Applied Accessibility Challenges on freecodecamp.

**R1D10 - December 16th, 2018**
Finished the Applied Accessibility Challenges on freecodecamp and started with Responsive Web Design and toying around with Flexbox.

**R1D11 - December 16th, 2018**
I think I added two entries today, don't know how to count it, one was around 1 AM and this one around 9 PM. Did an unhealthy amount of HTML/CSS learning today, feel great! Check out the cool TODO List I started making at my Portfolio site: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/

**R1D12 - December 18th, 2018**
Today I experimented a bit more with flexbox and started learning around display: grid. It makes me think of bootstrap for some reason.

**R1D13, R1D14, R1D15 - December 19th, 20th, 21st, 2018**
I have poked around a lot learning css tricks and best practices, I also updated my Registration Form, made it look a lot cooler IMO and I also implemented a bunch of cool looking tricks and learned about the importance of labels to make forms accessible, check it out on my portfolio: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/

**R1D16, R1D17 - December 22nd, 23rd, 2018**
I have been having fun learning different tricks and stuff you can do in CSS for the past couple of days. I improved my form and I think that it looks pretty good, anyone willing to give me feedback? check it out: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/onlineform/html/index

**R1D18, R1D19, R1D20, R1D21, R1D22, December 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 2018**
I have been tweaking my Portfolio page and my projects, learning about using Grid and improving the overall look of my pages. I remade the Tribute Page I had made on CodePen, but did it locally on my laptop and uploaded it to my portfolio. Have been highly productive these past few days, working for more than two hours each day and I feel really happy. Haven't gotten the gist of making a webpage look good, but I know I'll get there eventually. Check out my latest progress at: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/

**R1D23, R1D24, R1D25, R1D26, R1D27, R1D28, R1D29: December 30th, 31st, 2018; January 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 2019**
I have been having a lot of fun learning about using grid, flex-box and a bunch of other stuff. Have spent a couple of days working on my survey form project and another couple of days learning about typography and making the fonts look good on the website and how important it is for the user experience and overall feel of the website. I'm thinking about starting to implement what I've learned as I go. Have also been learning about webdesign and what is important to create a good layout. I should be updating my advancement with the 100 days of code challenge, but lately I've been focusing more on working than on posting. On days when I don't work specifically on the projects or updating my portfolio, I try to practice and learn about something else, making sure that I'm not letting my days go to waste. You can see my latest project at: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/surveyform/html/

**R1D30, R1D31, R1D32; January 5th, 6th, 7th, 2019**
On day 30 I made the social media links on the footer look a little better and added and effect to them when you hover over the links. I also learned about adding mailto:mail address as an href on the anchor tag property to open the default mail editor on the user's machine, which is nice.
 
On day 31 I was reading about and trying to understand CSS Locks, Molten Leading and Fluid Typography, and started implementing them on my Tribute Page project

On day 32 I still don't get fluid typography quite well, but I was following the guidelines of the following people:  

Geoff Graham
Tim Brown
Mike Riethmuller and this one
Richard Rutter

Finally, I made the text look better by following Matthew Butterick's advice on typography.

I'm not entirely happy with the look of the Tribute Page, and it still looks awful on my cell phone; but overall I think it looks good enough. I'm looking forward to the day that these concepts click on my brain but I guess that I'll get there with more practice and time.

**R1D33; January 8th, 2019**
I fixed the display on small devices by changing the max-width of the secondary image to be on "em" instead of a percentage of the parent div #secondary-img, I also removed the prefixed size of 500px entirely. Finally, to make the header look better on the smallest resolution, I changed the grid-template-rows to be (45vmin 1fr and 3%) instead of the (10% 1fr and 3%) that it was before.

Finished making the Tribute Page look good on mobile devices. Perhaps I should test a bit more before affirming that, but right now it display correctly on my cell phone. I removed some unnecessary stylings from my css file that were causing the page to display incorrectly. I also learned that mobile browsers scale the page down automatically and that that behavior could be controlled with a meta tag called viewport.

Started working on improving how my portfolio landing page looks on mobile devices (at least on mine), I need more feedback on this because I don't know if it looks good enough on other resolutions, I checked my portfolio page on my wife's phone and it didn't look as bad as I expected, even though I was navigating in Safari. At least the fluid typography was displaying on a readable manner. Right now I only improved the automatic scaling for mobile devices for my Portfolio and changed the background image size to be "contain" when the resolution is 700 pixels or less because the image was not scaling well.

**R1D34; January 9th, 2019**
Today I played around with fluid typography on my portfolio's landing page, I think it looks good enough. I also used Molten Leading for the line height and I think it looks good too. I still have to fix the sizes of the boxes on some resolutions which IMO they look kind of weird.

**R1D35, R1D36; January 10th, 11th, 2019**
Started working on the Product Landing page project. At first I had no idea how to begin, but then I found that I tried working on something similar back in October of 2017 when I used to do drop-shipping on eBay. I had an interesting layout and that's what I'm gonna try to recreate here. I will not add any Bootstrap at this point because I feel that that would be like cheating on myself, I rather keep doing this with pure and simple HTML and CSS for now. Maybe in the future I'll add more styling and improve the project a bit, that's what I have been doing for everything else so far. Check out the project here: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/product/html/index
