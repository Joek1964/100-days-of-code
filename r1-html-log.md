**Log**

**R1D1 - December 6th, 2018**
Completed two Pomodoros on freecodecamp's Applied Visual Design curriculum. This is something I made from a previous example on the basic HTML and CSS part of the course: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/practice.html

**R1D2 - December 7th, 2018**
Kept advancing on the Applied Visual Design challenges on freecodecamp. The published site on GitHub pages should be updating automatically when I push the changes. Here's an improved version of the previous CatPhotoApp with visuals improved a bit: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/practice

**R1D3 - December 8th, 2018**
Did some lessons of the Applied Visual Design challenges on freecodecamp. Confirmed that the published GitHub page for the CatPhotoApp is updating automatically when I push the changes. Here's the current version: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/practice

**R1D4 - December 9th, 2018**
Today I didn't advance on freecodecamp because I decided to start working on my online CV, I've always wanted to make one and I think that it is coming along nicely. Found a way to add collapsible lists using CSS only. Here's the mockup? layout? how do you call this thing? Anyways, here's the link: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/onlinecv/html/index

**R1D5 - December 10th, 2018**
Added a navbar to the CV to navigate between sections. Added anchors for correct positioning when navigation on the page using the navbar. Also discovered that the css file was not linking correctly to the published page and fixed it.

**R1D6 - December 11th, 2018**
Made the CatPhotoApp look psychedelic with a bunch of colors and crazy animations. Also changed the folder structure for the project. Check it out at the Portfolio website. https://mr2much.github.io/webdev

**R1D7 - December 12th, 2018**
The stars on the CatPhotoApp are now displayed at each side of the "main window" instead of at the top, I was reducing the width of the BODY element, I changed it to reduce the width of the main container instead. Also finished the Applied Visual Design challenges on freecodecamp, going to start the Applied Accessibility Challenges.

**R1D8 - December 13th, 2018**
Did some of the Applied Accessibility Challenges on freecodecamp, and it's finally here, my customized landing page for the online portfolio, tremble world for I am powerful: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/

**R1D9 - December 14th, 2018**
