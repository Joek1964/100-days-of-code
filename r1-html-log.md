**Log**

**R1D1 - December 6th, 2018**
Completed two Pomodoros on freecodecamp's Applied Visual Design curriculum. This is something I made from a previous example on the basic HTML and CSS part of the course: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/practice.html

**R1D2 - December 7th, 2018**
Kept advancing on the Applied Visual Design challenges on freecodecamp. The published site on GitHub pages should be updating automatically when I push the changes. Here's an improved version of the previous CatPhotoApp with visuals improved a bit: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/practice

**R1D3 - December 8th, 2018**
Did some lessons of the Applied Visual Design challenges on freecodecamp. Confirmed that the published GitHub page for the CatPhotoApp is updating automatically when I push the changes. Here's the current version: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/practice

**R1D4 - December 9th, 2018**
Today I didn't advance on freecodecamp because I decided to start working on my online CV, I've always wanted to make one and I think that it is coming along nicely. Found a way to add collapsible lists using CSS only. Here's the mockup? layout? how do you call this thing? Anyways, here's the link: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/onlinecv/html/index

**R1D5 - December 10th, 2018**
Added a navbar to the CV to navigate between sections. Added anchors for correct positioning when navigation on the page using the navbar. Also discovered that the css file was not linking correctly to the published page and fixed it.

**R1D6 - December 11th, 2018**
Made the CatPhotoApp look psychedelic with a bunch of colors and crazy animations. Also changed the folder structure for the project. Check it out at the Portfolio website. https://mr2much.github.io/webdev

**R1D7 - December 12th, 2018**
The stars on the CatPhotoApp are now displayed at each side of the "main window" instead of at the top, I was reducing the width of the BODY element, I changed it to reduce the width of the main container instead. Also finished the Applied Visual Design challenges on freecodecamp, going to start the Applied Accessibility Challenges.

**R1D8 - December 13th, 2018**
Did some of the Applied Accessibility Challenges on freecodecamp, and it's finally here, my customized landing page for the online portfolio, tremble world for I am powerful: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/

**R1D9 - December 14th, 2018**
Did two pomodoros for the Applied Accessibility Challenges on freecodecamp.

**R1D10 - December 16th, 2018**
Finished the Applied Accessibility Challenges on freecodecamp and started with Responsive Web Design and toying around with Flexbox.

**R1D11 - December 16th, 2018**
I think I added two entries today, don't know how to count it, one was around 1 AM and this one around 9 PM. Did an unhealthy amount of HTML/CSS learning today, feel great! Check out the cool TODO List I started making at my Portfolio site: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/

**R1D12 - December 18th, 2018**
Today I experimented a bit more with flexbox and started learning around display: grid. It makes me think of bootstrap for some reason.

**R1D13, R1D14, R1D15 - December 19th, 20th, 21st, 2018**
I have poked around a lot learning css tricks and best practices, I also updated my Registration Form, made it look a lot cooler IMO and I also implemented a bunch of cool looking tricks and learned about the importance of labels to make forms accessible, check it out on my portfolio: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/

**R1D16, R1D17 - December 22nd, 23rd, 2018**
I have been having fun learning different tricks and stuff you can do in CSS for the past couple of days. I improved my form and I think that it looks pretty good, anyone willing to give me feedback? check it out: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/onlineform/html/index

**R1D18, R1D19, R1D20, R1D21, R1D22, December 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 2018**
I have been tweaking my Portfolio page and my projects, learning about using Grid and improving the overall look of my pages. I remade the Tribute Page I had made on CodePen, but did it locally on my laptop and uploaded it to my portfolio. Have been highly productive these past few days, working for more than two hours each day and I feel really happy. Haven't gotten the gist of making a webpage look good, but I know I'll get there eventually. Check out my latest progress at: https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/
