# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 3 - Clay Reber

The log for my third round.

## Log

### R3D1 (12/12/20)

Back at it again. Spent most of the hour trying to follow along with a flutter project, but I felt like watching the video wasn't breaking my fear of coding. So now I'm working on building a Klotski puzzle solver similar to my sudoku one. Example of Klotski can be found here: https://www.schoolarchimedes.com/klotski. 

Kind of pissed with myself. Felt like I didn't get anywhere and spent too much time looking for the perfect starting point. It's a constant issue I hope this project will eventually get rid of.
