Day 2: May 21, 2018

Today's Progress: Watched the remainder (over an hour) of lecture 1 of the fast.ai course in my hotel room.

Thoughts: I took it slow and watched the lecture while multi-tasking a little bit.  It was great because the professor said that most people watch all of the lectures several times, read the forum, and study numpy, jupyter networks, and play around with building neural network models.  I have been fairly terrified that I wouldn't be able to commit to 100 days of progress in coding.  But getting into it a bit, I feel like I have a shot at this.

Day 1: May 20, 2018

Today's Progress: Watched part of lecture 1 of fast.ai course, set goals for Round 2 of #100DaysOfCode.

Thoughts: It was insanely difficult to restart on this.  Work pressures kept me afraid to move forward.  And for some reason, I had trouble working on this while traveling.  Even though I have nothing better to do in the hotel.  No family commitments, work isn't that all-consuming.  I sat down and set some goals and watched the first part of the lecture during Tess's silks class.
