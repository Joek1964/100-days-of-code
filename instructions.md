# Download Instructions
This repository is used mainly for logging my daily activities related to 100 days of code challenge and
for storing related code for my projects. While it is easy to clone the entire repo working with such a complex directory might get tough.
As such I'll show you how to easily clone just a chosen project.

### Single Project Instructions

```
git clone --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/mtrzuskowski/100-days-of-code
git sparse-checkout add path/to/chosen/project
