# Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment
### *I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

#### Start Date
July 22nd, 2017.

## Additional Rules
1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23100daysofcode).
2. If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
3. I will push code to [GitHub](https://github.com/jacobwarduk) every day so that anyone can see my progress.
4. I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
5. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge.

## Even More Additional Rules
1. I will learn something new every day, otherwise the day doesn't count.
