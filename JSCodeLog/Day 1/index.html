        <h1>Day 1 of 100 Days of Code</h1>
        <br/>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong><br/>This is a simple html page that runs two basic Javascript functions upon loading. The first one displays
          an alert which displays the word "Hi" and the second one writes to the console log. This is meant to get warmed up with JS and setting up
          the environment and tools that I'm going to need over the next 100 days as I go from zero to hero in Javascript.</p>
        <p><strong>JS Code:</strong></p>
         <pre>
            <code>
               /*jslint devel: true */

              //show an alert message saying hi
              window.alert('Hi');
 
              alert("Hello World!!");

              //print something in the console
              console.log('Welcome to JS!');
          </code>
         </pre>    
    </body>
