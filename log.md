### Day 6: June 27th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Read a few chapters of the nature of software development

**Thoughts**: Understanding the importance of deploying via feature to feature vs. project as a whole. When you deploy feature by feature, you know what you want it to do and how it should interact with other features. When is comes to planning for the project as a whole, you are focused on multiple parts at a time and don't have time to get into the entire ins and outs on what exactly what specific things should truly do. You don't give the features they deserve and in turn get the results you are expecting. When we set timelines and base getting the project at a certain time, features hav to be compromised in order to set those timelines. When we take it a feature by featue basis, we get the features we are expecting and even though we may not make the deadline, the project as a whole is of much better quality.

### Day 7: June 28th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished up my todo app using vue.js and node.js

**Thoughts**: Vue.js is very interesting. So far am I loving the feel of it. I like how everything for that component is in one file so it makes it easier to manage. I still need to do more practice to understand the in and out, but so far I am having fun with it.

### Day 10: July 7th, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Got started on creating a react native app hiting a video game api.

**Thoughts**: Took a bit of break, had a hard time getting motivated. Also had a few things going on. But now I am back at it, and want to make a mobile video game search app. Expo snack is limited in what it can do so need to bring it down to my local environment.

### Day 11: July 8th, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Started a vue.js app that hits a video game api

**Thoughts**: Going to do the video game api using vue and make it mobile friendly. Brining Native down to my local env would cause me to downgrade npm. Vue is super cool. Plan is to render the info I am getting, add some authentication, and CSS it up

**Link(s) to work**: Haven't push it yet, some commented out code I need to delete


### Day 12: July 11th, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Have video games items rendering and added some CSS

**Thoughts**: Vue.js is really easy to understand and work with. Liking it a lot. Need to add auth

**Link(s) to work**: Still haven't pushed up code. Need to clean some files and componentize.

### Day 13: July 16th, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Was working on routes with vue, then stumbled upon [Dev Challenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/wBunSb7FPrIepJZAg0sY)

**Thoughts**: Dev Challenges is more front end focused but it gives me something to strive for without me trying to figure out projects on my own

### Day 14: July 18th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started a node.js project using okta and express-generator. 

**Thoughts**: I am really, really love working with node. Will wrap up this project and go back to do a dev challenge
