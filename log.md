# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 01, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Solved a 7 Kyu kata on codewars. It took me awhile to find the answer. I'm also creating a robo friends app, I made the first component tonight. Started Modern JavaScript tutorial. 
**Thoughts:** I really feel like I struggle with JS. I can solve most problems with pseudocode but the actual syntax eludes me. I bought some more courses on Udemy I think they will help.


### Day 1: March 02, 2019

** Today's Progress **: Added a search bar for my robofriends app and learned about state and props. I'm still a bit confused on the concept of one way data flow. I learned the 7 basic types in JS. String, Number, Null, NaN, Undefined,Infinity and objects. I may be wrong but I've read somewhere that all of them but objects hold the value in menu and thst objects just reference the point in memory where it's value is located. Also I started a blog on Medium!
