# 100 Days Of Code - Log
//my Log// 
### Day 1: July 21, Wednesday

**What I Learnt Today** Getting a better understanding of using Git bash's commands, 
learned how to shallow copy and deep copy Objects in JavaScript, 
and better and manipulating arrays in JavaScript.

**Thoughts** I'm getting in deep with JavaScript now, but i feel like there is so many other Coding Languages that I have to learn or keep up with.
Git Bash is giving me a hard time, I need to Review my CSS and a bit of HTML, and JavaScript is starting to get hard.
My plan of action is to learn more Git Hub/Git Bash Thursday and Friday, and then Saturday lean in more to JavaScript for those Kew concepts in my meeting with Jamal Saturday. 
Then Sunday I'll chill and try and review/build things with HTML and CSS.

**Feeling** A bit intimidated, but I am hopefull and still ambitious when it comes to coding oppurtunities!

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
