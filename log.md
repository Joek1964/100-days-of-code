# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<hr>

### Day 1: July 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**  
Tried working on a solution for reversing a string with a while loop. 

**Thoughts**   
I have seen numerous examples of solving this with a for loop, recursion and built-in methods. A while loop may not be the optimal, but I wanted to mix things up to see if it was possible to solve.

### Day 2: July 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**   
Was able to reverse a string with a for loop. Unable to solve recursively(need to get a better
understanding of syntax).

**Thoughts**   
Today I've learned:
* `length` method can be applied to arrays and string
* Javascript follows the _lexical scope_ principle 
  * i.e. in nested functions, the inner function has access to both inner and outer variables. Whereas the outer function only has access to outer variables.

### Day 3: July 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**   
Skiped a day because I fell asleep last nightðŸ˜“. Was unable to reverse a string recursively.   

**Thoughts**     
Kept trying to make my solution similar to a for loop by declaring variables.  
Recursion is sometimes not the most optimal solution, which is true in this case.  

Today I've learned:
* build-in methods `substr()` and `charAt()` are required to solve problem

### Day 4: July 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**   
Attempted _Sock Merchant_ problem from Hacker Rank on *Repl.it* website. Was able to solve for key-paired values sock object.  

**Thoughts**     
Hacker Rank considered this a warmup problem, but it is definetely not for beginners.  

Today I've learned:
* how to create/add key-paired values to an empty object with conditional statement

### Day 5: July 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**   
Attempted to _Sock Merchant_ problem on *Repl.it* again. Was able to target all property values. Was unable to get tally of even pairs of socks to solve problem.

**Thoughts**     
Once I am able to get tally of even pairs, this solution will need to be combined with first solution(key-paired values sock object).

Today I've learned:
* `Object.values` method can be used to return property values within an object

### Day 6: July 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**   
Attempted to solve _Sock Merchant_ problem on *Repl.it* again. Was able to get tally of all even pairs with reduce method.

**Thoughts**     
The `reduce` method is a powerful one and can be used to perform tally-up an object for number of occurence and getting total count of an array. Will attempt to use only `reduce` to arrive at solution.

### Day 7: July 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**   
Attempted to solve _Sock Merchant_ problem on *Repl.it* on final time. Was unable to combine *for loop* with *reduce* method successfully. This was probably due to scoping issues from the *reduce* function. 

**Thoughts**     
After looking at HackerRank solutions, I had the correct idea with solving for object then solving for even pairs. This does give me some assurance.

### Day 8: July 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**   
Attempted to review other users solutions from HackerRank. Was unable to understand solutions and get them to work in text editor.

**Thoughts**     
Instead of copying/pasting  solutions in text editor try to recreate the problem and apply solution in a different text editor.

### Day 9: July 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**   
Took an assessment(expired) for a job I previously applied for. Format of the test was as follow:  
* 5 multiple choice problems
* 1 Array sort problem
* 2 React project problems 

**Thoughts**     
Will look for similar problems to practice with. Unfortunately I was unable to start server after cloning project.

### Day 10: July 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**   
Attempted to sort an array in meandering order. Was able to sort array in descending order but not in meandering order. 

**Thoughts**     
Today I've learned:  
* methods such as `push`, `unshift` cannot be applied to an empty variable

### Day 11: July 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**   
Attempted to sort an array in meandering order. Was unable to solve even after looking at a solution for a similar problem. 

**Thoughts**     
Will have to take things down a notch working then work my way up toward interview type questions.

### Day 12: July 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**   
Started the **10 Days of JavaScript** challenge on HackerRank. Was able to solve *Day 2: Conditional Statement: Switch*.

**Thoughts**     
Taking it back to the basic to build momentum   
Today I've Learned:  
* fall-though technique can be used for multiple cases that will execute the same statement
* return statement cannot be used inside switch statement

### Day 13: July 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**  
Attempted to solve a loop and *Regex* problem. Was unsucessful and may be over complicting problem with a *for* or *while* loop. 


**Thoughts**     
Try to solve problem without using a *for* or *while* loop and only `match()` with *Regex*
