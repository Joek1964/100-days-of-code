# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 27: February 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I'm still working in my Twitch Web App, I'm implementing new code to display the streamers media in the app, but it is not working as the first time, of course. I will see it!

**Thoughts:** I stopped for some days again, I get stuck in my learning process for this reason. But, it happens when you don't handle your time very well, you get tired so fast and your energy go down.

### Day 26: February 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: From my Twitch App, I defined the streamers as a global variable, it is more easy to access. I improved the function to iterate in the array with forEach method, then it get the JSON for each value and store in a new array where I can access all data. I noticed the forEach method, it is a little crazy to iterate, because it does not save the data in the order. The media list for All, Online and Offline streamers was implemented and settled at the document.ready jquery. This is important when the user click in any option it will load the current streamers.

**Thoughts:**

### Day 25: February 02, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I stopped for a moment my Twitch App to study Noje.js and MongoDB. So it was necessary unsderstand some conceps like REST API and CRUD, and at my first time it was easy and hard to get the theory and compare with the practice. Also, I learned how to start with Node, basic commands, json package that's essencial for everything in a node project. Besides, MongoDB has the javascript essential as JSON, but when you just know relational database and see in a different way the data, it can be confuse.

**Thoughts:** New stuffs to learn, it's cool!

### Day 24: February 01, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I'm working in my Twitch App yet, so what I did it was understand  more the DOC API to define how to get the JSON by the channels. So, first, I need to define which channels I want to get the informations, this is not a good deal (it could be interesting to ask for random online or offline channels and these to be sent), then see who is offline and online and work with the online data. I designed the app, what I need do is set the right data in the right place. I get stuck for some moment to iterate in the streamers array and get the JSON to each one, but it's not work because $.getJSON is asynchronous! So cool ¬¬ Now I need try some ways.

**Thoughts:** Think more about JavaScript with asynchronous requests.

### Day 23: January 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I reading the twitch API and your boring problems to access the data, a small progress and get stuck!
**Thoughts:** Normal, but not everyday!

### Day 22: January 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I designed by Twitch App, and now I'm working in this app, and I watched two videos of React.

**Thoughts:** Without thoughts today!.

### Day 21: January 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More onde day with React, reading and learning the documentation. I've seeing concepts like arrow functions, classes, elements, components, JSX. And, wow! We need to take a break.

**Thoughts:** A small progress for some minutes. But, it's better than anything.

### Day 20: January 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I decided to get started my project called De Bus, so I'm planning on the paper and how to start a open source project, so I'm searching about it. Also, I started to study React to make the application to solve a social problem, and I learned about const, let,a little bit about components and elements, so I have an overview. Let's go! First, I need to define the technology stack like database, libraries, frameworks, application, design, etc, etc. And, at the same time I'll keep my journey of FCC building the next project, Twitch TV.

**Thoughts:** I'm tired but I keept study and focused!


### Day 19: January 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I finish the Wikipedia Viewer from freeCodeCamp, and learn how to use animate.cs and working more with the for loop logic. So I'm happy with my progress and with the UI of the application.

**Thoughts:** I thought today I won't finish my Wikipedia Viewer today, but I did it. Now I was seeing my progress on FCC, and I'm close to finish my front end path. Oh, I lost a day in my challenge, so I'll add more one day at the end. It's the rules.

### Day 18: January 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I finish the prototype map app to present for an interview, it's a good solution at the end. Now I'm finishing my wikipedia viewer. I'm making some loops to iterate through the array and set the right information to each col in a row. ;)

**Thoughts:** At the end of the day, I did my job and I'm on tracking

### Day 17: January 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I implemented the solution using the leaflet.js. In this application I have static coordenates that are equivalent to the stations, and I need to simulate dynamic positions from the objects received by JSON or sent by the back end. So, I created an object, and I'm iterating in this object to show the objects on the map, but the problem is the iteration in the event. Each iteration is not displayed by parts, instead the loop run and show everything after that.

**Thoughts:** I need to come back to the basic and think more about these loop or event.

### Day 16: January 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked study more one time the leaflet.js to implement a problem. I learn how to set a marker, a polygon and a circle in the map, and all these things are keep in one variable, it's awesome the power of javascript.

**Thoughts:** I thought don't get into this day, but  I did my progress, a small, but it was ok!

### Day 15: January 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked in the the style of the app.

**Thoughts:** I dind't manage the time very well again!

### Day 14: January 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I was working in my Wikipedia Viewer, and I completed some tasks like get the string input, request to the WikiMedia API and get the JSON. The action I'm using is the opensearch, and it makes a search in the database and return some information. I will work with thumbnails and make them in cards, but I think I'll use a bootstrap plugin to display and fix the thumbs abroad the screen. I liked that, it is so cool! So, at the end I will see the lenght of the JSON and display the number of thumbnails on the screen with the size of the object. Now, I'm giving some style and probably I'll change the font-family too and apply some effects. Also, before all this I was trying to get the JSON from the WikiMedia API on codepen, but I get a problem with the CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), so I tried to solve using the cross-origin but at the same way it dind't work. And I found a solution talking about the WikiMedia make a CROS request. At the end, it was necessary just send a parameter as the origin.

**Thoughts:** Good day, don't ask why but I feel improving my front-end skills! I get stuck in some parts, of course, normal, but I recover and I get more paciente to think and solve the problems.

### Day 13: January 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I find the action to make the wikipedia Viewer works, and search for a value in the database! I defined the variables to each parameter and I'm using jQuery to get the input value. For now, I'm using only one function to handle it.

**Thoughts:** With many for to do today, I get the minimum time to work on my challenge, it was a small step, but it's normal in unexpected days.

**Link to work:**

### Day 12: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I stopped for more than a hour to study and implement leaflet.js on codepen. I'll build a simple app to display point on the map to simulate some human actions to solve a simple problem. I'm doing it as part of a intership challenge.

**Thoughts:** Happy! ;)

### Day 11: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I get started in my Wikipedia Viewer, I made the sketch of the web app and I implemented with a search bar as a input-group in Bootstrap inside a container to fix in the screens size. I created a function to request the data in JSON, because it came as a first Thought in my head, saying create a function. I read a little bit of Wikipedia's API, and it has many options and paramets to choose the best one, and I think the action will be opensearch.

**Thoughts:** Today, my progress it was small again, just reading the implementing UI. I noticed when I start so late in my challenge it is more difficult to study and code.

### Day 10: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I finished the Local Weather App and I getted some CORS problems that I decided to fix later, so I'm using the IP-API instead the geolocation API. I asked for reviews of the App, and people liked. Now, I started the new FCC project, Wikipedia Viewer. I finished an user story, now I need to study the wiki API and handle the data do display the information to the user. I'm working with bootstrap again, because it's easy to learn and apply.

**Thoughts:** Today, I notice when you really make progress and study something new to implement in some project, you get fast to think more and have many ideas about how to implement a component, a style, etc. Don't stop, never!

### Day 9: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I studied minimalist design to design the style of my weather app as card, and I read the material documentation to implement a card with UX. It takes some hours, and now it's good. Also, the weather has the weather icons and material design lite as a toggle button. The app has two versions of JavaScripts files, the first one is using the geolocation API and openWeather API and the second is using the IP-API and openWeather API.

**Thoughts:** It's important be opened to study what is necessary to implement and build anything. I never Thought one day study minimalist design a little deep and liked it. I'm tired for take many hours fixing design and code, testing it. Now, this weather is done and finished.

### Day 8: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I'm done with the user stories of the weather app. I use JQuery to display the data, the user can choose between Celsius or Fahrein, and shows a weather icon. But, I need to give some effects or animations with JQuery and CSS. So, my goal is create a google card weather app and I need to set the right font-family, font-size, etc.

**Thoughts:** Study design is superficial, it's our ideas with the others. And sometimes your forgot what you want.

### Day 7: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I'm finally finishing the Weather App. I'm using to APIs, one for the location and another to get the weather. I handled the JSON data and I'm displaying on the page. It's good. Now, it's missing to set a toggle button to change the temperature between C or F and display an icon weather. In this case, I'm using the weather icons, but the problem is just increase the size of the icon to be more visible. And the style on the page I'll be a responsive card with the main data with shadows to give a UX different like material design.

**Thoughts:** Working all these days have showed me we need be paciente when we are learning, and not to be so fast. I fail and tried many times, implement different stuffs in my application. Now, I have a good feeling!

### Day 6: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I tried to use the ip-api instead to use geolocation API. It is good because I get the data by JSON.
**Thoughts:** More onde day, I dind't finish yet, oh my oh my!

### Day 5: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I re-doing my work create a good code with functions. I have a functional code, but it is a big mess, dind't work when I need handle more. So, today it was more a day to understand the methods, objects e functions. I'm doing very well, for while my progress it is the same, but improving my code and my understanding.

**Thoughts:** I'm ok, I'm like a newbie understand more again, and read, and read. It's better than just read, try it, if works, move forwad. No, I need hack the way I get the knowledge. It's the best way for in the future, DONT BACK AGAIN.

### Day 4: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today, I handle all the data from JSON, but all my code is a confusion, and it is difficult to make some changes and update the HTML when it is necessary. I take off the bootstrap toggle plugin, because it was not working to set some text inside the toggle using JQuery. I deleted the convert temp functions and I'm doing in the variables, it's awful. But, I'm display the data on the page, so it's means I understand how it works, now. So, I will re-do my work creating especific funcionts and call them when necessary. I noticed the page was slow to update all the data. I need to know, why.

**Thoughts:** Today I coded for more than a hour, I'm happy with my progress, it's being slow, but I like. I get stuck just for some minutes, besides, I was tired.

### Day 3: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I'm yet working in my FCC project, it is taking more time than I expected, but it is ok. Finally I handled the JSON from OpenWeather API using getJSON and acessing them as objects. I'm working with some functions, like to get the JSON and others to convert the data as temperature in C or F. Now, I need to display the data in the right place on the page, set some style following an UX. I found out a bootstrap toggle that's a bootstrap pluguin the converts checkboxes in toggles. I'll use to change the temperature to C or F.

**Thoughts:** I read an article on the repository about get dark in code that helped me to come back to work and understand why sometimes it is difficult. I lost one day, so add more one in my track to follow the rules. Now, I see it is not easy to anyone finish or complete something. I get some troubles to understand functions, methods and objects again. I wanted to manipulate functions and methods more easy. The way it is showed or the statement it is a little difficult to get at some time.

### Day 2: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I did a small progress in my web app project on FCC. I just set the openweather API correctly and getted the JSON that I'm displaying on my page. Now I need to handle the JSON to complete the user stories.

**Thoughts:** When you have many tasks for to do, it is difficult to handle the time and sit down to code. I get stuck more one time, but I did in the last of the night. I did!

### Day 1: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I created a function to get the geolocation after read and understand the API, and another function to get the JSON from the API openweathermap. Also, I studied a little of the bootstrap documentation to set the jumbotron class as a card of my web app. I organized my code with some containers and <div>'s. With some inspiration to style the app it will look cool in some commits.

**Thoughts:** I notice the first part is start the day, but when you make that differently everyday with some motivation about "I need to improve, I need to fight with myself to be better". It was necessary read the APIs documentation again again and remember how works a method, a function, a jQuery handle, and you think if you are good enough to make the job. But when you see it is necessary to come back some steps to go up. Wow, it's awesome.

### Day 0: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I get the geolocation from the browser and I tested the openweather API for my project on FCC.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with JavaScript and JQuery, why? Because I've stopped for a long time without code anything. It's a piss off, really. Don't do that. Now, I need to recover again, study more to understand what I'm missing.

**Link to work:** I will up my repo for my GitHub.
