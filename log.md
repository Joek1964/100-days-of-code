# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 12, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on Checkio.org and Leetcode.com

**Thoughts** I started coding in a Data Science Bootcamp and learnt so much about machine learning and so on. Now I want to become fluent in Python. So I start with some bascis.
