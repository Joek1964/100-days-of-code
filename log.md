# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 27, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Applied styles to Michelle Obama tribute page in FCC

**Thoughts:** This is fun! And it really is hard to stop once you get going.

### Day 2: October 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Applied more styles to Michelle Obama tribute page, also
fixed some typos. I copied the code into a Codepen and linked to it from my
repo's readme.

**Thoughts**: This is really fun! This first coding challenge is pretty simple
though. Actually, I considered adding more flourishes to the site but thought
it just didn't fit the challenge brief.

### Day 3: October 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the Survey Form challenge.

**Thoughts**: It's been awhile since I last created an HTML form. It's like
riding a bike - I just have to glance at the documentation for a refresher on
things, but it's all coming back.

Here's where I left off today:

### Day 4: October 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished the user stories in FCC's
[Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Survey Form](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-survey-form)

**Thoughts** Today was slower than previous days. I got stuck on
trying to style the checkboxes in my form. I found some advice on the w3schools
site, as well as on Stack Overflow, but wasn't able to successfully style the
checkboxes as I had wanted to.

I also asked in FCC Discord and the person who
responded reaffirmed that these are notoriously difficult to manage with CSS.

So after awhile I moved on without applying the styles I had wanted.

### Day 5: October 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Went through FreeCodeCamp lessons on CSS Flexbox and CSS
grid. I experimented with applying the material to my site but didn't merge
any code.

**Thoughts**: I've used this stuff before but it's been awhile, so it's good
to review. I think that layout is the toughest part about CSS, in my experience.
