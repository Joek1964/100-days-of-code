# 100 Days Of Code - Log

 Day 1: December 3, 2019

Today's Progress: Finished up HTML Essential Course @lynda, I need to consolidate my learning.

Thoughts:At first, it looked so easy but it has some key-points to learn more and more.

Day 2: December 4, 2019

Today's Progress: studied CSS and HTML, forked 100-days-of-code project. I watched some github videos, but I couldn't manage to do a pull request. I will figure out tomorrow.

Thoughts: I like interactive apps like SoloLearn, it gives me motivation when I see everyone is doing the same thing like a virtual school. I made some progress in HTML and CSS.

Day 3: December 5, 2019

Today's Progress: I have found my mistake while cloning a repo.I mistakenly didn't check where I cloned and everything got messed up. I couldn't make any changes since I couldn't find the local file.After reading and checking some websites, I could delete and clone and tracked the local file at last.I ddid Sololearn exercises, and tried to write some code about how to build a blog.

Thoughts: I noticed that it's better to think and analyze myself rather than relying on tutorials.Practice is the best and permanent solution.
