# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 30, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Restarted work on JavaScript Calculator project for free code
camp. Using Vue.js 2 instead on jquery.


**Thoughts:** Met up with fellow newbie programmer at cafe for Northside Chicago fCC
meetup! Only two of us, but hopefully will get more in the coming weeks. Decided to share
our progress for the week and what we've learned. That way, we'll have another drive to
work on projects so that we have something to present others. Also, it'll give us practice
talking about code.

It feels great to start this commitment again. I really think this will give me the focus
that I need.
