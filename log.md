# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 5 December, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a Gatsby project for my portfolio using the hello world starter theme.

**Thoughts:** Gatsby is still very new to me. I am figuring out the project file stucture and testing out different themes. Started the tutorial by CodeAddict "Gatsby - Strapi portfolio"  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asB-dUwpH4Y. Learning to use React custom hooks for the first time.

### Day 2: 6 December, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continue working on my internship task the Talent Profile page. Completed components: Linked Accounts, User Details, Address. Almost finished working on the Nationality component but unable to continue due to issues with microservices not responding.

**Thoughts:** The Microservices within the project keeps closing unexpectedly and it is creating problems with debugging/testing. I have tried clean/rebuild in visual studio and close and restarting the npm server. 

### Day 3: 7 December, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Internship task. Completed Nationality component which allows talents to set their nationality. Starting working on the Languages component

**Thoughts:** Languages component requires tables, input text form, input option form, semantic buttons, semantic icons. Looking into semantic grids to format the components nicely
