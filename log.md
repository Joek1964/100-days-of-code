# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 23, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Re-committed to the challenge, decided to focus on Rust, with a secondary goal of becoming more proficient with Git and GitHub. Forked the 100DaysofCode repo, cloned it down to my Mac, and made a branch to do my updates on. Spent a frustrating few hours working on forking the create-react-app repo so that I could potentially make changes to it, but ultimately decided to give up. Did some reading about alternative methods for starting React apps, found Parcel as an alternative bundler. Seemed nice, but struggled to get MDX (Markdown for JSX) installed so moved on. Decided to try going back to NextJS, as my foundations are better and I'm probably more ready for it. Worked through the blog tutorial on the NextJS site and got it deployed to Vercel via a GitHub repo.

**Thoughts:** Have some ideas about how I can learn Rust in a more structured way. Will use the Rust Book as a guide, but need to be more active in my reading of it, rather than passively reading through from beginning to end.
