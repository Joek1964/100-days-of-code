# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: February 22, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through more one time in my Twitch App Project on FreeCodeCamp. This time I settled a switch case for all, online and offline streamers case. For each case I get the JSON using getJSON function iterating with a for loop. Also, each case is activated when the user choose a nav-tab, so it is necessary change the nav using jQuery.

**Thoughts** Read and Search and implement it. Take a time, think more, make mistakes but save your code before :)

### Day 1: February 21, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through my Twitch App Project on FreeCodeCamp. I get stuck applying the same solution for a different problem. So, I tried a different solution and it is working. Next, I'll use jQuery to activatethe nav-tabs and filter the streamers channels.

**Thoughts** Try different solutions for problems you think that same solution it'll works!

### Day 0: February 20, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Condition If Else implemented in my Twitch App to verify if JSON is null or not but it's not working. Maybe the forEach function or $getJSON can be asyn while it interating the array.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with getJSON function to the get the data at the same time. I need to see how to fix it to make my app works!
