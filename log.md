# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 13 March 2019

**Today's Progress**: Forked git repo, set up SSH keys for Github, created local clone of repo, and updated this file from local. Created new repo for ruby-shapes and tried to recreate an exercise I did almost a month ago from memory. 

**Thoughts:** Some aprehension about committing to 100 days of code. Looking forward to the challenge. Got sucked in and spent a leetle bit more than 1 hour on the challenge today.

### Day 1: 14 March 2019

**Today's Progress**: Created new repo and cloned locally. Began working on a Ruby text adventure game. Have pushed today's work to Github. 

**Thoughts**: One hour goes by too fast. Game is currently sitting at 67 lines - many of them comments. I think part of this challenge is working out how much coding is achievable in one hour.
