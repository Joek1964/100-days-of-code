**Today's Progress**: Built a drumkit in Javascript

**Thoughts:** To get me started without getting trapped in indecision about what to learn I am working through Wes Bos great 30 day challenge on vanilla javascript. shout out to [Wes Bos](https://javascript30.com/)

**Today's Progress**: CSS Clock

**Thoughts:** Realised how little I know of the css transition, and transform properties. Interesting to 
see how much can be achieved with a little bit of maths and css.
