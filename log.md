# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

- Started setting up the lambda server for brain of my bot.
- Created an endpoint to return true or false if progress log.md (this file) was updated with today's progress.

**Thoughts:** Setup Python3 env, Zappa and basic Flask App. Feels like it took 1.5 hrs to just setup and play with simple github API, need to improve my speed. Refactored logic and simplified requirements in second pass

### Day 2: Jan 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

- Created webhook for messenger bot to talk to
- Connected messenger bot to api, simple bot set-up

**Thoughts:** Need to spend more time reading fb messenger api. Should not be that hard. Github example repo was super helpful to quickly get things up and running. Will need to refactor brain.py soon.

### Day 3: Jan 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

- Refactored code, more to go
- Fixed Timezone bug
- Added notification for no progress update

**Thoughts:** Need to start writing tests. Weekends should be heavier than couple 100 lines of push. Push Push Push!!

**Link to work:** Nothing to show yet
