# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 29, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I've created all of the neccesary accounts as well as stood up my Ubuntu dev environment.

**Thoughts** Feels awesome to get organized and start down this path. It's going to take some effort to keep from being distracted between learning at work and here.
