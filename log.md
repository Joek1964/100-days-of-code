# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did a GitHub tutorial, did some Javascript FreeCodeCamp lessons.

**Thoughts:** I wasn't going to commit to #100DaysOfCode right away because I had other things I wanted to do first.  But if not now, when?  I feel pretty good about what I learned in GitHub and FreeCodeCamp.

### Day 2: December 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More Javascript FreeCodeCamp lessons.

**Thoughts:** Feeling a little weird about doing lessons instead of working on my codepen projects, especially given that I have not finished one of the projects.  But getting back into the swing of daily coding is important, and it's what I can do right now.  Should feel good about that.  I know I'll return to codepen to finish at some point soon.

### Day 3: January 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More Javascript FreeCodeCamp lessons.

**Thoughts:** Did an hour of FreeCodeCamp while Maggie drove from VA to NC.  Felt good to do the work.  But I also realize that, for someone like me with a background in C and C++, this stuff is a good refresher but remedial.  The hard part will be writing actual code.  Also, after an hour in the car looking at a computer screen, followed by 4 hours of driving, I'm kind of feeling car sick.
