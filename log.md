# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 4, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: 
I'm building an RGB color game. There will be six squares that will have random colors. Based on the RGB color code shown at the top of the page, the player will be able to guess which is the correct color. The player will be informed whether or not they chose the right color and will have the option to try again. For now, the colors are hard coded. Eventually, a random color will be given and the player will be able to chose which is the correct color of the six colors shown. 

- [x] In HTML, there are six divs with different background colors for each square.
- [x] In CSS, each div is styled with the following properties:
  - background color
  - padding-bottom
  - float
  - margin
  - width
- [x] In JS:
  - An array of six hard coded colors.
  - A hard coded default RGB color value (for now) in the h1 tag.
  - Click event listeners that alerts the player of the color that was clicked on.
 
**Thoughts:** 
I'm glad I was able to start building a color game. However, working in Cloud9 is challenging. I spent quite a bit of time looking for errors when it turns out c9 was the issue.  I may have to go back to using Caret as the text editor on my Chromebook.


### Day 1: December 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
I need variety, so I decided to take a break from the color game and try to get a basic understanding of Docker. The lesson I worked through introduced me to containers, images, dockerfiles and volumes.

**Thoughts:**
I had a hard time understanding the basics when I tried learning Docker in the past. This time around it was easier. Containers and automation are very interesting to me. Iâ€™m glad I took the time to work through a lesson.


### Day 2: December 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
- [x] If the wrong color is clicked, the color fades to the background color leaving only the remaining possible answers.
- [x] Notification to the player for whether or not the correct color was chosen.
- [x] Changed span color.
- [x] Wrote random number function to generate a random RGB color for each game.

**Thoughts**
This was an interesting day. I spent most of it running from one appointment to the next so I didn't code as much as I wanted to. As the day comes to an end and the fairies temp me with sleep by sprinkling sleepy dust on me, I had to stay focused and code for at least an hour. I did it!

### Day 3: December 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
- [x] Changed background color for h1.
- [x] Created random number function and removed hard coded RGB color values.
- [x] Wrote a for loop that pushes random color into an empy array.
- [x] Wrote randomColor function that generates random color for each value of RGB.

**Thoughts**:
The more I work on this project the more fun I have and I'm getting a better understanding of VanillaJS.


### Day 4: December 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
- [x] Worked through some algorithms on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)
- [x] Watched a freeCodeCamp [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsCjFHuMXj0) on "How to build a Node.js API".

**Thoughts**: 
API's are fascinating! The more I learn, the more I wonder about how I can use API's to access data and how I can build my own. 


### Day 5: December 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
- [x] Created a button that displays the text "Play Again or New Colors" 
  - If the player wins the text displays "Play Again"
  - If the player hasn't won but, would like a new set of random colors the text displays "New Colors" to start a new game   with six new random colors.
- [x] Color display resets to default color when game is won.
- [x] Functioning buttons for "Easy" and "Hard" mode.
  - Easy/Hard mode button have selected class to show current player mode.
- [x] Wrote logic to display three random colors when "Easy" mode is selected.
- [x] Wrote logic to display six random colors when "Hard" mode is selected.

**Thoughts**:
It took me a while to get started today. Once I got going it was hard to stop. Learning Vanilla JS is fun so far. It's more code to write but, I'm learning so much! I was reading through the API documentation on [coinbase.com](https://developers.coinbase.com/) and now I want to learn how to build API's to access my account information. I have no idea how to do that yet, but, I'll learn.


### Day 6: December 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Styling
- [x] Added border radius to change squares to circles.
- [x] Added the text-transform property to make text uppercase
- [x] Added padding, spacing and margins in header and stripe containing text for colors and game mode.
- [x] Added hover and animation effect to buttons and squares
- [x] Changed font
- [x] Changed font-weight on h1 
- [x] Changed font-size for span

**Thoughts**:
Margins and padding was a little tricky but, overall, I enjoy working with CSS.


### Day 7: December 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
- [x] Refactored code!
- [x] Finished game!

**Thoughts**:
Refactoring was challenging. I'm glad I broke up larger sections of code into smaller functions. The code is easier to read. Now that I finished the game. I'll go back and change some styling and maybe add an additional game mode.
