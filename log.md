# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Thursday, May 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've continued to work through "The Complete Web Developer in 2019: Zero to Mastery" on Udemy. Today I learned about Javascript conditionals, including "ternary operator" and "switch". I also went through the Basic HTML section of FreeCodeCamp as a refresher.

**Thoughts**: I've found learning Javascript to be difficult compared to HTML and CSS. It's hard to stay motivated when I don't understand the concepts or have a vision for what they should be used for just yet. I have continued to use google and other resources to help me understand concepts further. I am excited to begin this #100DaysOfCode to hold myself accountable and track my progress.

### Day 2: Friday, May 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've continued to work through "The Complete Web Developer in 2019: Zero to Mastery" on Udemy. Today I learned more about Javascript and instead of using var, use let and const. I also learned how to add default values to functions and use arrow functions.

**Thoughts**: I didn't do as much coding as I would have liked to today, but I am happy that I learned about ES6 and Javascript syntax that I will use going forward to make writing Javascript easier.

### Day 3: Saturday, May 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked more on FreeCodeCamp. I got through the Basic CSS as a refresher and moved onto the Applied Visual Design section.

**Thoughts**: The CSS refresher was good for me since I haven't looked at it in a couple weeks as I've been focusing on Javascript. I learned a few things I did not know from my other CSS courses.

### Day 4: Sunday, May 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked more on FreeCodeCamp. I continued to go through the Applied Visual Design section and learned about coloring and design for websites.  I also bought 'You Don't Know JS: Up & Going' which I will begin reading tonight.

**Thoughts**: I already knew some of what I went through, but I learned some syntax like "transform" and using different gradients. It was difficult for me to focus and be motivated over the weekend, but I'm happy I kept to this challenge and learned this weekend!

### Day 5: Monday, May 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've continued to work through "The Complete Web Developer in 2019: Zero to Mastery" on Udemy and went through some advanced functions, arrays and objects. I have also began to realize there are so many great resources if I get stuck in the course I am doing to google the topic and find other ways the topic is explained or more in depth and it's significantly helped clear things up.

**Thoughts**: Although I struggled with some of the topics today I didn't let myself get frustrated, took a short break and came back. I learned a lot today from my course and youtube videos and stackoverflow for more in depth analysis. There are so many great teachers with material out on the web. Today was a great day for learning JS!
