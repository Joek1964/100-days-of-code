<h1>100 Days Of Code | Journal</h1>
<h3>Blayze Stone</h3>


<p>My goal for #100daysofcode is to build a strong foundation of the basics and to take actionable steps towards becoming hirable as a junior front-end engineer.</p>
<p>@blayze.stone on instagram to follow my efforts more closely.</p>

<h2>Day-1</h2>
<p>I created a simple heading using HTML and CSS to officially start the challenge. I realize that I will need to focus on developing a strong understanding of CSS and how to use it. My first reaction is to use FlexBox to solve all of my positioning issues. I will be diving into CSS to learn all the different ways to solve my problems and the why for each solution, rather than go for the easy solution every time.</p>
