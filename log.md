# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 3: December 31, 2016 

**Today's Progress**: Configured a clear form button. Changed fonts and colors.

**Thoughts:** If you set the inputs to all have the same name, once you select a second radio button, the previous one will be deselected.

### Day 1: December 29, 2016 

**Today's Progress**: Changed the presentation and added radio buttons to select tip.

**Thoughts:** I didn't know where to start, so for fear of not starting at all, I forked a CodePen Repo and started pulling apart a tip calculator.
