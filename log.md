# 100 Days Of Code - Log

 ### Day 0: January 2nd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I got through 23 challenges on the Basic JavaScript section of freecodecamp.com.

**Thoughts:** Doing the math parts got me really confused.  Although, I noticed that I'm usually right with the answers but I second guess myself a lot.

 ### Day 1: January 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I got 12 in. I completely got stopped on the Escape Sequences in Strings challenge.  I just couldn't wrap my head around it and it put me to sleep.  So, I got up and showered,  sat down and tried it again.  Still couldn't figure it out so I just googled it.  Figured out the needed code and breezed through the next ten challenges.

**Thoughts**: I hear that most coders don't have everything memorized and that Googling answers is ok... right? Well,  I've been at this coding for almost 2 years now and I feel like I'm trying all kinds of ways to approach coding.  Up until recently I never gave Google too much use but now that I'm in that rhythm I hope I can start to get the hang of it.

### Day 2: January 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I got 16 in.   

**Thoughts**: Much easier today... or tonight than it was yesterday.  I didn't get too stuck for too long.

### Day 3: January 5th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Not much progess today... only 2 challenges.   

**Thoughts**: GEE WHIZ! Some of these challenges just make my brain bleed or something by thinking so hard.  https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/stand-in-line This challenge for some reason is not letting me through.  I think I have an idea of how to go about it but I feel like I'm missing a vital peice of info.  Maybe tomorrow I'll have better luck or maybe I can just brush up on my HTML and CSS and make some interests pages.

### Day 4: January 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I started a webpage that shows off what my interests are.  I'm starting out real simple, by doing most of the HTML first, then add styling.       

**Thoughts**: I feel like I should stick to what I know and continue with that and llearn new things as I go and as I need them.  Hopefully, that's a good strategy...

### Day 5: January 8th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Pretty good progress today,  I added a bunch of info to the first section and went a bit crazy with the zombie ipsum.       

**Thoughts**: I'm feeling pretty good about where this is going and doing one step at a time totally helps with my sanity.  I don't feel overwhelmed on how it will look or feel but good information to keep me on track.

### Day 6: January 9th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added more info to some of the categories and cancelled a website I had on GoDaddy because I was not feeling wordpress.       

**Thoughts**: I'm still pretty inspired to finish this web site and I'm getting more excited about getting my original website up as a progress report site.

### Day 7&8: January 10th & 11th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I added links to key topics so I didn't have to explain more than a sentence.  Added Sections to mind and soul.  More organized with topics and how to sort them.    

**Thoughts**: Writing out ideas first in a journal totally helps with organization not having to remember details.

### Day 9: January 11th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I started out with a bunch of php tutorials on how to make a blog and was on a roll... then got stuck only to find out it was outdated.  Took a break for a few hours and came back strong to keep working on my little project that I started.  I finished all three of my sections and got some example things in there so I don't forget what the pattern is.    

**Thoughts**: Working on things slowly and super small steps at a time with something like coding is amazing!  It keeps me challenged because it's review and I don't get ahead of my own knowledge and get frustrated and give up.

### Day 10 & 11: January 12th & 13th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've on a PHP tutorial rampage and have been soaking it all in and then applying them to my projects!  On my incrementalgradualist.com site, I got all the navigation, side bar and footer all on the include function on php!  Hopefully I'm using the right terms.  On my other project that I started, I began making a footer just for shits and gigs.  I plan on phping that so I only have to type it out once and just use the php code.    

**Thoughts**: Super confused about the dates but hey... I'm still coding everyday!  Learning languages for a key purpose makes things easier.

### Day 12: January 14th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Changed all of the html tags to php. Set up xampp so I could work with the php files locally.   

**Thoughts**: I'm foreseeing a road hump but I will do what I can to avoid it for face it.

### Day 14: January 16th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've been watching a bunch of PHP tutorials and doing the examples.  I've been practicing what I've been learning and applying it to my own project.  ALso, learning on how to do github commits and pushing and pulling without logging in? 

**Thoughts**: I'm glad I have to road maps to switch back and forth from and they are both doing the same thing with php but coming at it from different angles.

### Day 15: January 17th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added a very bacis navbar and footer to my interests project.  I went into phpmyadmin and made a few categories for a blog site.

**Thoughts**: MINI GOALS AND PLANS ARE WHERE ITS AT!
