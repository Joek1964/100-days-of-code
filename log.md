**Today's Progress**: #100daysOfCode day 5:

I wanted to visualise custom multi-day events in a calendar for a while, let's see how it goes.

https://t.co/fIuKOyb00N is pretty easy to use, it can be embedded in a few lines of code. 
I'll have many ideas how to fine tune it... https://t.co/5XumohPjQc

**Today's Progress**: #100DaysOfCode Day 6

I made a script to get size of folders per date from an s3 bucket using #s3curl and visualized it with #plotlyJS

I had around 1 hour time limit for learning and coding. Besides a nasty typo in "marker" based pagination, everything worked on the first try üéâ

**Today's Progress**: Today I got an hour to polish my calendar viewer that I wrote about a few days ago. It still has a long way to go but now it's usable enough for my needs.
I've added a github action to deploy it, and fixed some onboarding issues.

**Thoughts**: I needed to revisit date handling, but now it has a proper onboarrding experrience for newcomers. Mobile view is still a mess.
