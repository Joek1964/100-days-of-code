### Day 0: March 20, 2019 (Test)
##### (trying this out before this will be replaced by Day 0 tonight)

**Today's Progress**: <!---Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.---> 
  I need a project chosen to have workable improvements to it.

**Thoughts:**  <!--- I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality. ---> 
  The first part is selecting the project and working on it after work hours.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
