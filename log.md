# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 16, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Solved "Counting Duplicates" http://www.codewars.com/kata/counting-duplicates/train/javascript using map() and indexOf(). Now I want to solve it using other methods: reduce(), filter(), forEach() and recursion.

**Thoughts:** I think those methods are the core of JS programming, the better I know them the better my code will be.

### Day 3: October 18, 2016

I have decided to make this challenge to only about coding. I want to be a better developer and that includes design too. I will journal each day what new skills I have learned and what I need to learn / practice next. With the new changes 100 days is not more enough. I am extending it to 500 days. But thinking to committing myself to 1000 days.


**Today's Progress**: Today was the first day I started working in illustrator. Worked in Photoshop for 14 years but illustrator was just  not in my way =)

**What new skills I have learned**: 
* Shapes in illustrator.
* Shortcut keys:
    * Command + y
    * Control + C - Control + F
