# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 7th, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Finished the last 52% of the Applied Accessabilty portion of FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design track

**Thoughts:** I have not practiced coding in a while and so it was tough starting off in the middle of the section like that.


### Day 2: June 8, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: I got to 50% on FreeCodeCamp's CSS Grid portion of the Responsive Web Design Track. 

**Thoughts**: Things are starting to look more familiar to when a did html more regularly. I love this feeling.
