# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 25, 2021 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Started the Responsive Web Design curriculum on FreeCodeCamp. Worked on Add imgs, Link to external pages, Link to internal section of page w/ anchor element.

**Thoughts:** I already took some courses on HTML, but this is a good review. Was distracted towards the end, but did end up taking good notes to be able to refer back to whenever.

###Day 1: April 26, 2021
#####
**Today's Progress**: I have completely finished the basic HTML and HTML5 course. Worked on images to links, unordered and ordered lists, text fields with placeholders,
creating form elements, submit buttons, required fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, the value attribute, checked by default, div elements, declaring doctype, 
and finally, defining head and body. I also started the Basic CSS course in the last few minutes. I worked on changing text color, using css selectors to style, 
using css class to style, and changing font sizes.

**Thoughts:** I learned a lot in this course that I didn't learn in a whole book on HTML and CSS. Mainly the many different user inputs. I feel much more comfortable with HTML as a whole now. My new goal is to try to finish a whole course a day, as I feel if I put my mind to it, I can definitely learn a lot in a short amount of time. Some of the elements weren't hard, but the practice was just what I needed to engrain them in my head. I have been taking notes of everything to refer to at any time.

###Day 2: April 27, 2021
#####
**Today's Progress**: I have almost completely finished the Basic CSS course. Specifically, I covered font families, google font importation, font drgrading, image sizing, borders, rounded borders, circular images, background colors to div elements, setting ID of element, using id to style element, adjusting padding and margin, including negative margin and shorthand notation, using attribute selector to style elements, overriding styles, using hex code, shorthand hex code, rgb values, creating custom css variables, and setting fallback values.

**Thoughts:** After getting through so much in one hour, I definitely feel much more comfortable with HTML and CSS as a whole. I saw things I either already knew or just have seen before, but I also saw a lot of new concepts. I look forward to using these on my projects. 

###Day 3: April 28, 2021
#####
**Today's Progress**: I have completely finished the Basic CSS course. I have also started the Applied Visual Design course and reach over half way. Topics covered include: inheriting css values with :root, text-align property, adjusting width of element, height, strong tag, underline tag, em tag, strikethrough tag, horizontal line tag, background-color of text, font-size, box-shadows, opacity, text-transform options, font-size, weight, line-height, hover state of anchor, relative position, absolute position, fixed position, float, z-index, and auto margin.

**Thoughts:** I finally feel like I'm starting to understand CSS. Picked up most of the work very quickly. Very useful.
