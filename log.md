# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Today's Progress**: Applied styles to Michelle Obama tribute page in FCC

### Day 2: October 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Applied more styles to Michelle Obama tribute page, also
fixed some typos. I copied the code into a Codepen and linked to it from my
repo's readme.

**Thoughts**: This is really fun! This first coding challenge is pretty simple
though. Actually, I considered adding more flourishes to the site but thought
it just didn't fit the challenge brief.

### Day 3: October 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the Survey Form challenge.

**Thoughts**: It's been awhile since I last created an HTML form. It's like
riding a bike - I just have to glance at the documentation for a refresher on
things, but it's all coming back.

### Day 5: October 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Went through FreeCodeCamp lessons on CSS Flexbox and CSS
grid. I experimented with applying the material to my site but didn't merge 
any code.

**Thoughts**: I've used this stuff before but it's been awhile, so it's good
to review. I think that layout is the toughest part about CSS, in my experience.
