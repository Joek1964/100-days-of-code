# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 01, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Solved a 7 Kyu kata on codewars. It took me awhile to find the answer. I'm also creating a robo friends app, I made the first component tonight. Started Modern JavaScript tutorial. 
**Thoughts:** I really feel like I struggle with JS. I can solve most problems with pseudocode but the actual syntax eludes me. I bought some more courses on Udemy I think they will help.
