# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Find out this challenge interesting, why decided to join it.
My main goals is to extend and improve my basic knowledge around modern javascript frameworks and tools, which are currently using across many companies, despite they are basicly build above vanila javascript). I mean React, Angular, Vue, Ember, Ionic and probably not from this list - Electron (found a tutorial on Corsetra, want to try it some time later) and in other side, I want to become a self-taught full-stack developer, which means, that I must make my knowledge in PHP (at least) deeper. But ideally I would to learn other backend language, for example Ruby/RoR.
