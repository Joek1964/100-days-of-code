 Day 1: December 3, 2019

Today's Progress: Finished up HTML Essential Course @lynda, I need to consolidate my learning.

Thoughts: At first, it looked so easy but it has some key-points to learn more and more.

Day 2: December 4, 2019

Today's Progress: Studied CSS and HTML, forked 100-days-of-code project. I watched some github videos, but I couldn't manage to do a pull request. I will figure out tomorrow.

Thoughts: I like interactive apps like SoloLearn, it gives me motivation when I see everyone is doing the same thing like a virtual school. I made some progress in HTML and CSS.

Day 3: December 5, 2019

Today's Progress: I have found my mistake while cloning a repo.I mistakenly didn't check where I cloned and everything got messed up. I couldn't make any changes since I couldn't find the local file.After reading and checking some websites, I could delete and clone and tracked the local file at last.I ddid Sololearn exercises, and tried to write some code about how to build a blog.

Thoughts: I noticed that it's better to think and analyze myself rather than relying on tutorials.Practice is the best and permanent solution.

Day 4: December 6, 2019

Today's Progress: I focused on finishing SoloLearn course and I did. But I didn't understand the parts related to JavaScript. I will look at them after learning JS.Then, I read some documentation and watching w3cx courses.

Thougts: I am feeling overwhelmed by so many courses and resources.I don't know so many things. I hope I will have enough knowledge to build my own projects soon. I'll do my best to achieve that!Again, I will learn HTML and CSS, because I don't know totally. 

Day 5: December 7, 2019

Today's Progress: I studied at FreeCodeCamp and finished CSS section and moved on to Applied Visual Design.I stopped in the middle, I decided to learn more first, about what is written, I checked lynda course. Then, I downloaded Adobe Photoshop, and learnt a little. My computer got slow down, and it made me go nuts!

Day 7: December 9, 2019

Today's Progress: I watched TraversyMedia video and did CSS practice, and watching and taking notes while watching an EdX course.

Thoughts: I'm feeling like I'm moving so slow,but i have decided I will focus on what I'm learning not focusing on progress. Because you can move so quick but if i won't remember later, there is no use for me. So, take it slow. Relax and enjoy!

Day 8: December 10, 2019

Today's progress: I felt like I have so many information and I need to group them altogether. That's why I decided to create my own templates. I checked everything I wrote on my notebooks and files on my computer.Then, I found one tutorial about how to design a form, I decided to watch and practice at the same time. I couldn't finish because I don't know some parts.I will finish tomorrow.

I will try to fix that tomorrow. Then, I did challenge with logical questions, I learned so many new terms and HTML tags, it was informative. Then, I started to learn about Skeleton and started my last project. I found a very good course.I'm following that course, too. And, I finished one project about navigation bars with a video.

Feelings: I am feeling so happy actually, I wish I could discover this area before going to university. I never had any chance to see such websites before. This year I learned so many things and all by myself. This is incredible. I think school didn't teach me anything and I am really sad about that.

Day 19: December 22, 2019

Today's Progress: I continued on my last project. Portfolio page, styling is really making me stressful. I see that there are better options than using CSS. I want to learn other frameworks and and Adobe products to make it better the style. But, I got my certificate anyway. I'm happy that I finished; but I will keep coming back again.In this 20 days almost, I got so many certificates and different resources, it's amazing, I will share my certificates from Lynda, Sololearn and FreeCodeCamp.

Feelings: I'm happy but I haven't mastered everything yet; I listened to traversymedia and he also said we don't need to be a master in CSS before moving onto JS. That's why I will continue to learn different stuff, it is necessary to learn and combine different languages or programs.
