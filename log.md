# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 12, May 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Started adding web3 to a node/react project. Begun by adding Privy login to the embed wallet of the submissions app

**Thoughts:** This was painfully easy... but may not work long term. Currently my app is on create-react-app which requires Typescript 5<. Privy requires typescript 5>. I tried to set some overrides for a while but then gave up.

**Link to work:** pushed
