# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Forked the 100daysofcode repo, watched the introduction to what Flutter is and why to use Flutter.

**Learned**: 
1. Flutter uses Dart.
2. Flutter has a simple and flexible layout system that was inspired by the web and includes: Row, Column, Stack, Padding, and Center.
3. Flutter is Open Source, and you can dig into the code and see how the Flutter team implemented different widgets.
4. Flutter offers you one codebase for iOs, Android, Web, and Desktop.
5. Flutter has implemented Hot Reload - means the screen will update within fractions of a second after saving the code.

**Thoughts**: Looking forward to writing the first lines of code and digging deeper into Dart and Flutter. It might be helpful to learn more about Dart before continuing with Flutter, as Flutter uses Dart.
