# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 28, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Deleted unnecessary files in one of my repos.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with deciding to nuke this project where it was at, and start from scratch in other languages (was PHP/MySQL stack, now going to be creating it in Node, React, Express, and MongoDB), getting GitHub up and running, organizing files into a folder structure that would work, and overall just not being a newb. It's hard not to feel like a newb. lol

**Link to work:** [Deleted create-dashboard-page branch](https://github.com/MafiaRealm/MafiaRealm/pull/6)

### Day 1: December 29, 2017
**Today's Progress:** I finished five of the Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

**Thoughts**: These took a little longer than I thought they would! I struggled a lot on the Title Case challenge. Eventually I was able to complete it in a really awkward and seemingly inelegant way, and then when I checked the solution, I was right: there was a much more elegant solution... in fact, all of the solutions were far more elegant. I learned about the charAt() function in JavaScript.

- 01 ✅ Reverse a String
- 02 ✅ Factorialize a Number
- 03 ✅ Check for Palindromes
- 04 ✅ Find the Longest Word in a String
- 05 ✅ Title Case a Sentence

### Day 2: December 30, 2017
**Today's Progress:** I finished five of the Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

**Thoughts**: Some of the solutions varied widely from my implementations. I learned about the .repeat() function on the JavaScript String prototype. Interestingly, each of the solutions was harder to get right than I thought it'd be. I think I need to start planning more thoroughly before I begin, that'd probably save me a decent amount of time.

- 06 ✅ Return Largest Numbers in Arrays
- 07 ✅ Confirm the Ending
- 08 ✅ Repeat a String
- 09 ✅ Truncate a String
- 10 ✅ Chunky Monkey
