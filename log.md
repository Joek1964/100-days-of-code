## LOG TEMPLATE #1
### Day 0: February 30, 2016
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link to work:** [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 01/100: April 18th
**[LOG]**<br>
- Js syntax exercises on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#basic-javascript):
  -  `var`, `let` & `CONST`;
  -  `i++`, `+=` & `\"` operators;
- Simple Calculator web app initial commits.

**[NOTES]**<p align="justify">I've recently started coding, and it's hard. The first week of a language is very frustrating, but once I get the hang of it, it becomes satisfying as hell. A similar sensation is when I played Dark Souls for the first time. For example, today I wanted to blur a parent `<div>` without affecting its child, but (after more time than would like to admit) I stumbled upon a Stack Overflow post that said it was impossible. Luckily, there is a way of overcoming this by assigning a “grandparent” `<div>`, two smaller ones and making one of them with the ABSOLUTE property, so we can fixate it and ignore it forever after blurred.</p>

<p align="justify">Overall, it's been a fun day despite the frustration, because even though I couldn't finish the calculator app on a night like I planned (high expectations, huh), I actually managed to fix this one problem about it. I'm excited for tomorrow.</p>
  
**[PROJECTS & RESOURCES]**
