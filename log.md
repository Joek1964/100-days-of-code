# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 33: February 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**
Working on a Java project in Codecademy.
Read from PHP textbook for class.

**Thoughts**
I'm stuck on this project, so I'm taking a step back. Going to lay off coding for the rest of the day. 1/3 of the way through!! I'm pretty excited about that progress.

### Day 31: February 1, 2017
** Today's progress**
Worked on creating a simple HTML form and using PHP to dynamically change an validate it.

**Thoughts**
PHP seems beefy and I'm not sure this is the route this class will take. I'm not going to head down the rabbit hole until I get the syllabus and see where this course is heading. Got PHP and MySql installed on RHEL 6.8.
Learned the difference between GET and POST.

**Thoughts**
I didn't get the correct number for the last level. I went through the code again and I think I need another set of eyes. :-(

### Day 28: January 29, 2017
** Today's Progress **
JavaScript 'use strict' & DOM code challenge


**Thoughts**
I went to a MeetUp today. We learned about 'use strict' and the implications and silent failures that can happen if you don't use it. There was a pure JS DOM manipulation code challenge and I froze. jQuery would have been easier, but that wasn't the challenge. I stillh haven't finished it. When I have time, I'm going to go over the DOM.

### Day 20: January 20, 2017

** Today's Progress**
Worked on short programs in Java from Pluralsight and Java in 21 days book. Finished the jQuery section of FCC

**Thoughts**
More reading and comprehension than usual. Since the Java class started, I have less time to just play and require more time to specifically focus. Not a bad thing, just not the best way to get some coding in.

### Day 19: January 18, 2017

** Today's Progress**
Fixed the split check function. **win**
```javascript
var split = document.getElementById('splitCheck').value;
```
**Thoughts**
I have been away from the Tipcalc for over a week and I came back with a new perspective, unclouded by past hangups and mistakes.I didn't have the `.value` after the variable declaration. That was the biggie, then the other issues where solved one by one. I took time to just look at each line, write down some notes and the mistakes made themselves know. I can check this off my list.

**Task List**
[x] Get split check option to work
[] Add bootstrap or make responsive on mobile
[] Media Query to remove slider div on mobile
[] Create favicon
[] Add comments to code
[] create my own 404 page
[x] Add a split check option

### Day 18: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**
A few short programs from my Java textbook and finished up the java section on CCodeacademy

**Thoughts**
Not much in the way of coding, but much more comprehension. Java Documentation is very helpful and most online docs from big vendors is undeniably horrible. I was so surprised and read as much as I could.

### Day 17: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**
Making my way through Codeacademy's section on Java to bone up for class starting.

Created 2 Java programs. Reviewed more on classes and objects.Ending the night watching a video on Java. I'm up to video 10- flow control.

**Today's Progress**: I did my hour on Free Code Camp. 

**Thoughts:** A full day at work and teaching afterwards.. I'm just glad I have something to show some progress. Finished the HTML5 & CSS section. I also started revamping the Header and nav on my tip calc. That's something....right?

### Day 7: January 4, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Not much to speak of. Read some of JavaScript for Web Developers, then did my hour on Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts:** A little frustrated, a lot determined to learn more and understand. I won't stay away from the project too long. I know there is a lesson in this process.

### Day 6: January 3, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Not much to speak of. Still working in the console to 'see' what's going on. Coercion has caught me up. My input from my prompt( ) is a string and not a number.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm missing something. I need to read up more on coercion, so this makes sense and I can gain a working knowledge of why this is happening.

### Day 4: January 1, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Seperated Check split from tip calc. Added js button to other page. I didn't upload to site, yet.

**Thoughts:** Adding the splitCheck to the tip calc broke the calc. I decided to move it to it's own page. I need to figure this out.

**Task List**
[x] Add a split check option 
[] Add bootstrap or make responsive on mobile

### Day 1: December 29, 2016
