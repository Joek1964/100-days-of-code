#100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Uploaded landing page/ portfolio to github. Made edits to
project cards, fixed typos, etc.

**Thoughts**: I feel very insecure about putting myself out here, but I also
feel that I'm coding in a vacuum. I also feel that I'm not ready, since I don't
list every project I've completed for freecodecamp (fCC) on my landing page.
But-- better to publish and add features as I go rather than to never publish at
all.

   -**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

   -**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
