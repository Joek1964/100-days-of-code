# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Working through Gatsby's tutorial step 6/7

**Thoughts**: The markdown plugin didn't seem to work properly even after I restarted development. The pages were partly showing up but not fully on the /sdf page wasn't like the example. I'm planning on finishing the tutorial and then working on a podcast website so I can play around with an api.

### Day 2: April 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finishing Gatsby's tutorial step 8

**Thoughts**: Even after doing the build and the serve it didn't change the audit. Learning about PWA's and the Audit tool was really interesting - I would love to understand performance better and how to increase site performance more.
