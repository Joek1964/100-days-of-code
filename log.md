# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 22, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I started my programming time by doing day 06 of Javascript 30 which took just over an hour from start to finish. Today's project was a search box that when typed in, it would show a list of suggested cities and states based on the input. It was a nice refresher for fetching data and how to transform and use it in the content of the page only using vanilla javascript instead of something like react. After I finished (and ate lunch) I added the README file to the project and pushed it to github with the finished project code. When that was done, I spent about 20 minutes working on the HackerRank 10 days of js. I did 03 of the challenges which had me work with creating objects, counting objects, and creating classes which was not something I have a ton of experience doing so I was able to add that to my study list. Since everything went pretty smoothly today (and theirs a blizzard outside) I did day 07 of js30 as well. This was more array cardio and was a pretty good confident boost as I didn't have to look up almost anything to get these all working as posed in each challenge.

**Thoughts**: It's hard to tell how much progress you have made until you go back and touch on core topics like this and realize that you actually know how to do a lot of it from memory (or at least have an idea what you need to search for). Doing this has really made me realize all of the steps I have made in the past year. Seeing this makes me even more excited to see where I am at the end of this 100 days of code and can't wait to come back and read each of these.
