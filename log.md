# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 13 March 2019

**Today's Progress**: Forked git repo, set up SSH keys for Github, created local clone of repo, and updated this file from local. Created new repo for ruby-shapes and tried to recreate an exercise I did almost a month ago from memory. 

**Thoughts:** Some aprehension about committing to 100 days of code. Looking forward to the challenge. Got sucked in and spent a leetle bit more than 1 hour on the challenge today.

### Day 2: 14 March 2019

**Today's Progress**: Created new repo and cloned locally. Began working on a Ruby text adventure game. Have pushed today's work to Github. 

**Thoughts**: One hour goes by too fast. Game is currently sitting at 67 lines - many of them comments. I think part of this challenge is working out how much coding is achievable in one hour.

### Day 3: 15 March 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on pub adventure game. Have pushed update to Github. 

**Thoughts** Game is currently sitting at 171 lines. I've started using the 'TODO:' tag in comments where I know I need to do more, or want to add a new feature so I can come back to it later. There's plenty of things that don't work properly at the moment as the top down approach means adding high level features and then filling in the details, thus the "TODO:" tag so I know where to come back to tomorrow. Lot's of details still to be written.

### Day 4: 16 March 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on pub adventure game. Mostly Working on the intro logic, terminal formatting, and 's - search' logic. Have added 'junk.rb file.' Have pushed update to Github.

**Thoughts** 
- Game is currently sitting at 179 lines.  
- Spent some time setting up formatting to increase usability - spaces and lines break up the page by stages and has improved readability of the game when testing
- Don't try and use a += on a variable with a zero value 
- When developing while loops it can be helpful include a 'break' just before the end of the while loop so you're only testing one iteration in the early stages and there's no fear of an infinite loop
- Using a junk file to store code that I might want to use later but isn't working right now rather than commenting out blocks of code keeps the main file clean, readable and working 
- Re-writing strings that don't make sense in the current game logic is easier than re-writing game logic that currently works so that the current strings make sense
- Fixed a bug with the pub_description method I hadn't noticed until now - it was calling a sample pub_name rather than the current_pub so the user output was not what I intended it to be.
- Noticing a tendency to want to remove a feature if I can't get it working straight away so constant reminder to self: "Don't remove it, let's figure this out..."
