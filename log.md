# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Set up 100-days-of-code repo and joined FreeCodeCamp. I completed 25 challenges related to setting up my account, HTML, and CSS

**Thoughts:** I had a lot of velocity since I did most of the stuff required for the first challenges already--but I needed the HTML review. I wasn't planning on starting all of this until tomorrow, but since I had the day off, I couldn't help myself. There were a few things I learned that weren't covered at Codecademy (or I forgot everything...)

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the HTML challenges "Link to External Page with Anchor Element" to "Style the HTML body element" = about 25 challenges.

**Thoughts:** Again--a lot of velocity but I learned some new stuff today. All of the form element stuff was new to me. I'm still not sure how it actually connects to a database, but I'll figure that out someday. Maybe tomorrow! I feel like I should take a few days after completing the HTML track to actually mess around with my own code. Maybe even experiment on some web pages at work. Otherwise I'll forget this stuff. Also--I like the dead link feature. That was new to me as well. And I even found a dead link on a website built by a friend today ;)
