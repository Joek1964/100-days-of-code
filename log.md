# 100 Days Of Code - Log

 Day 1: December 3, 2019

Today's Progress: Finished up HTML Essential Course @lynda, I need to consolidate my learning.

Thoughts: At first, it looked so easy but it has some key-points to learn more and more.

Day 2: December 4, 2019

Today's Progress: Studied CSS and HTML, forked 100-days-of-code project. I watched some github videos, but I couldn't manage to do a pull request. I will figure out tomorrow.

Thoughts: I like interactive apps like SoloLearn, it gives me motivation when I see everyone is doing the same thing like a virtual school. I made some progress in HTML and CSS.

Day 3: December 5, 2019

Today's Progress: I have found my mistake while cloning a repo.I mistakenly didn't check where I cloned and everything got messed up. I couldn't make any changes since I couldn't find the local file.After reading and checking some websites, I could delete and clone and tracked the local file at last.I ddid Sololearn exercises, and tried to write some code about how to build a blog.

Thoughts: I noticed that it's better to think and analyze myself rather than relying on tutorials.Practice is the best and permanent solution.

Day 4: December 6, 2019

Today's Progress: I focused on finishing SoloLearn course and I did. But I didn't understand the parts related to JavaScript. I will look at them after learning JS.Then, I read some documentation and watching w3cx courses.

Thougts: I am feeling overwhelmed by so many courses and resources.I don't know so many things. I hope I will have enough knowledge to build my own projects soon. I'll do my best to achieve that!Again, I will learn HTML and CSS, because I don't know totally. 

Day 5: December 7, 2019

Today's Progress: I studied at FreeCodeCamp and finished CSS section and moved on to Applied Visual Design.I stopped in the middle, I decided to learn more first, about what is written, I checked lynda course. Then, I downloaded Adobe Photoshop, and learnt a little. My computer got slow down, and it made me go nuts!

Thoughts: I decided to not to compare myself to others, because my life and my background is totally different, I'm a different person, I will just focus on my progress.I wish I had a better and fast computer to work for Adobe Creative Cloud apps.

Day 6: December 8, 2019

Today's Progress: I worked with a blog project and tried to understand and worked with CSS on FreeCodeCamp.

Thoughts: I think I need to immerse everything before moving more. I will use and practice what I learnt.

Day 7: December 9, 2019

Today's Progress: I watched TraversyMedia video and did CSS practice, and watching and taking notes while watching an EdX course.

Thoughts: I'm feeling like I'm moving so slow,but i have decided I will focus on what I'm learning not focusing on progress. Because you can move so quick but if i won't remember later, there is no use for me. So, take it slow. Relax and enjoy!

Day 8: December 10, 2019

Today's progress: I felt like I have so many information and I need to group them altogether. That's why I decided to create my own templates. I checked everything I wrote on my notebooks and files on my computer.Then, I found one tutorial about how to design a form, I decided to watch and practice at the same time. I couldn't finish because I don't know some parts.I will finish tomorrow.

Feelings: I wish I had more time to learn especially know, but impossible.I'm doing whatever I can. I will continue to FreeCodeCamp;but I have so many other resources, too. I don't know which way to go. All of them is highly interesting!

Day 9: December 11, 2019

Today's Progress: I finished the form design project and finished also FreeCode Camp Accessibility and Responsive Web Design Principles. After that, I watched edx course about again HTML. I did also SoloLearn challenges today.

Feelings:I'm feeling good,just need to practice always. I will do SoloLearn, edx, lynda and FreeCodeCamp.

Feelings : I'm feeling motivated.

Day 11: December 13, 2019

Today's Progress: I decided to work with Tribute Page project. It has become a huge help for me to understand all the CSS properties. I'm feeling I' m getting the logic better now.

Feelings: I was more involved in concepts while making the project. Now, I understand why it's really important to make my hands dirty and tackle the problems myself. I see them now like a learning resource, really important.

Day 12: December 14, 2019

Today's Progress: I finished CSS Essential Training on Lynda.com then I started another CSS course about building an online resume page.I worked on Codepen and tried some CSS code on my project. I watched a little WesBos CSS Grid videos. They look so awesome.Learnt  about CSS Regions, Columns, and Exclusions.

Feelings: I wanted to do more than this but I couldn't finish all that I wanted. I don't know how to manage my time. I have so many things to do and continue to FreeCodeCamp.
