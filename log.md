# My #100DaysOfCode Challenge Log

There are a number of projects and goals I've had in my head or on the back-burner for some time. These are what I am hoping to work on.

### Projects
 - Personal website
 - Pok√©mon Trading Card App
 
 ### Goals
 - Improve my understanding of core features of ES2015, ES2016, ES2017, and ES2018.
 - Gain a working understanding of Angular 4.
 - Gain a working understanding of ReactJS and its eco-system.
 - Gain a working understanding of Typescript
 
They seem like some heavy goals to achieve in just over 3 months of coding. But you need to stay positive!

## Round 1 - Started on July 17, Monday, 2017.


### Day 1
I didn't really achieve much of what I set out to do today because I spent most of my time setting up this bloody #100DaysOfCode thing! But, I've gone over a couple of things in Angular 4 and generated a new project, with components using `angular-cli` - you can [see it here](https://github.com/jacobwarduk/jacobwarduk.github.io).
