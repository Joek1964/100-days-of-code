# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 14, 2024

**Today's Progress**: I am reading a full description of how Github works and intend to do ano hour of code when I finis, I will keep you  posted. 

**Expanding on that progress:** 
Wow! So it looks today was a lot more useful than I thought. Even though I ended up asking AI for some idea for code... since I didn´t really know what to do, I was quite entertained, realizing I didn´t know how to start a codespace from scrathc, I did but then I didn´t have the option to view my code in browser (If I do I don´t yet know how to) so I had to fork (this I knew how to do) a repo from 4geeksacademy where I´m learning *(2nd week bootcamp now)* in order to get the code from there to use the Python server. 

I made some readme on that repo. with a picture and a phrase by great Zen Master Shunriu Suzuki using markdown option that I learnt yesterday. 

**Thoughts:** 

I didn´t really know how to tackle this, I probably haven´t figured it out yet, but I´m determined to learn!
