# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 1: April 26, 2018- Thursday 

**Today's Progress**: Refreshed myself via FreeCodeCamp, on Compound assignments w/ augumented addition, multiplication, subtraction and division. These operators do both a mathematical operation, and assignment in 1 step. Also refreshed on escaping literal quotes in strings by using a backslash. 

**Thoughts:** I have to ensure that I constantly code. As soon as I begin practicing it all comes back, but I have to stop with the long breaks in between studying, and coding.

Day 2: April 28, 2018- Saturday 

**Today's Progress**: Refreshed myself via FreeCodeCamp lessons on Concatenating strings w/ plus(+) operators, w/ the plus equals(+=) operator, w/ variables. Appending variables to strings w/ (+=). Finding the length of a string (.length). & using bracket notation[] to find a character in a string.

**Thoughts:** Refreshing on the past material is coming along better. I realize it helps for me to not only type the code on a web browser/computer, but to also write it down on pen and paper.

Day 3: April 30, 2018- Monday 

**Today's Progress**: Refreshed on String Immutability. Using Bracket Notation to find the Nth character in a string. Using Bracket Notation to find the last character in a string. Using Arrays to store multiple values in one var. How to access Array Data w/ Indexes(Zero Based).

**Thoughts:** This material which I have refreshed on today I remember a majority of it.

Day 4: May 1, 2018- Tuesday  

**Today's Progress**: Refreshed on nesting one Array within another Array. How Arrays are mutable and can be changed freely. Accessing multidimensional arrays with indexes. Manipulating Arrays with “.push()”, appending data to the end, .pop() , removing data at the end ( "popped" off data can be stored in another assigned variable). ".shift()" removes data at the front, and ".unshift()" adds data to the front. 

Refreshed on Functions() and their use. How "Parameters" are placeholders for values, called "Arguments". 
 
Refreshed on the term "scope", and how it is the visibility level of a variable within, and outside a function. Variables    that can be accessed outside of a function have "Global Scope", "Local Scope" are variables that can only be accessed     within a function. If two variables have the same exact name, 1 is global, and another is local. the Local variable will take precedence. And finally, the "return" statement can be used to send a value back out of a function.  

**Thoughts:** Refreshed on alot of material, today via FreeCodeCamp. But was stuck on a problem caleld "Stand In Line", which I am still trying to figure out (although I have already seen the solution for it in the past, but I believe that is what I need to work on, which is to solve these problems completely on my own before looking at their solutions)
