# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 16: January 19, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the Free Code Camp Timestamp Microservice project again. I deployed what I have to Heroku.

**Thoughts:** I was mostly reading documentation, but it will come in handy going forward when deploying apps that require a back-end. I should be able to finish this project tomorrow night.

**Tutorials:** The Complete Node.js Developer Course.

**Reading:** None.

**Time:** 1 hour

### Day 15: January 18, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the Free Code Camp Timestamp Microservice project. Got the basic structure set up. It serves a static page so far.

**Thoughts:** I wasn't feeling motivated to work on my random quote machine. Got interested in node and express so I started the timestamp project. I prefer to be learning something new.

**Tutorials:** How-to-NPM and Git-It on Free Code Camp.

**Reading:** None.

**Time:** 1 hour 15 minutes

### Day 14: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Added tweet button to random quote generator and started working on the CSS.

**Thoughts:** The design of this particular project will probably only appeal to me. I don't care.

**Reading:** None.

**Time:** 1 hour

### Day 13: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Fixed the issue with the nav and copyright not working. Still haven't cracked the collapse on click issue with the toggle on the portfolio page. Worked on adding some styles to my random quote machine as well.

**Thoughts:** I am going to walk away from the portfolio page for a while. I may discover the solution to the nav issue as I work through other projects.

### Day 12: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Fixed some of the issues with the navbar. I looked really good, but it stopped working properly. I corrected an issue with my contact links that I got some feedback on Twitter about.

**Thoughts:** I live streamed for the first time today. I think I am going to start live streaming all my work. The day had a stressful end when I found that I broke all my nav and footer. It has to be javascript related.

**Reading:** None.

**Time:** 1 hour 30 minutes.

### Day 11: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Fixed navbar and layout issues. I have the portfolio to the point I need to add some projects and fix a couple of bugs. I submitted it to FCC, Reddit, Facebook, and my Discord channels for feedback.

**Thoughts:** Feeling pretty good about my ability to use certain tools to make stuff look the way I want. I am excited to start populating the projects section as I continue on.

**Tutorials:** None.

**Reading:** None.

### Day 10: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued work on navbar for FCC portfolio site. Fixed some styling issues.

**Thoughts:** I am still not happy with the navbar. It is time to ask for help. Working on and knocking out other issues is a moral booster.

**Time:** 1 hour.

### Day 9: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on navbar for FCC portfolio site. Fixed some classes and deleted some unnecessary lines. Attempted to move to Alpha 6 and decided it was too much work. I am very close to having the navbar looking and acting the way I want.

**Thoughts:** Working with alpha releases is a pain. There are less answers available to problems. I learned a lot about experimenting to get the look I want.

**Tutorials:** None.

**Time:** 1 hour 40 minutes.

### Day 6: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Odin Project Google homepage clone. I have all the elements in place. They just need to be positioned and styled.

**Thoughts:** Today was a drag! I didn't feel great in the morning so I got nothing done then. I was more able to work on it in the evening.

**Tutorials:** Watched part of CS50 Week 1. Struggled with their C library. I need to watch the videos on setting up the dev environment.

### Day 4: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Added a sticky footer to my reaction game.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Added image to portfolio and hid it when screens size is small. Added blurb in about section. These both need some improvement, but they are both there.

**Thoughts:** I really am enjoying this daily practice. I am going to read through all the Bootstrap 4 soon. There are a few changes in classes from Bootstrap 3. I am going to read some articles about getting hired as a developer. I am really tired today.

**Time:** 1 hour

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked through several user stories, features and bugs on portfolio.

**Thoughts:** Felt really good to break things into small pieces and knock them off one by one. Left with an issue getting image to hide on small displays with bootstrap. HTML is formatted terrible. Need to figure out linting I think.

**Time:** 1 hour 40 minutes
