# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2018, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started the HTML5 and CSS challenges for the Front End Development Certification

**Thoughts**: Thus far I'm not feeling too tested with these challenges. I'm sure that will change as I progress.

### Day 2: January 2, 2018, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the remaining HTML5 and CSS challenges and got through about 1/3 of Repsonsive Design With Bootstrap section.

**Thoughts**: Today I felt a slight tug not to do the challenges because I'm a little tired and Winter break with the wife and kids is starting to come to a close. In addition to that I ended up checking my work e-mail before starting so I began my hour somewhat distracted; not a good idea. Maybe tomorrow I'll try to give myself a few minutes to sort of reset my focus before starting.

### Day 3: January 3, 2018, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the remaining Responsive Design with Bootstrap challenges and got through about half of jQuery section.

**Thoughts**: Once again felt a slight resistance to starting the challenges, but I pushed through it. I didn't make the same mistake as yesterday by reading work e-mail. Nevertheless I was still somewhat distracted. The jQuery section is proving to be slightly more difficult than previous challenges mostly because I'm not that familiar with JavaScript syntax. On the upside, I do feel like I'm actually learning with these challenges so that's exciting.

### Day 4: January 4, 2018, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the remaining jQuery challenges and began work on the Build a Tribute Page project.

**Thoughts**: Didn't feel as much resistence today as I did in the previous couple of days. I've switched from Tron Legacy to Inception for music to code by; I think I like Tron a little better. :) The jQuery exercises were pretty straight forward, but I'm a little fuzzy on targeting child elements. I don't quite understand how the .target class with nth-child(n) magically finds the right element. That's just something I'll have to research a little more.

### Day 5: January 5, 2018, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Nearly completed the Tribute Page project.

**Thoughts**: Had a couple of interruption during my coding session so I spent a few addition minutes working on the tribute page project. Coming up with an idea for this project was a little difficult because I'm not that creative. I finaly came to the conclusion (right or wrong, but hopefully right) that the content of the tribute page is not what matters, it's demonstrating the ability to use what has been learned up to this point. Now I did have to google a couple of bootstrappy things, like block quotes, gradient backgrounds and rounded corners for my main "header" image. Hopefully tomorrow I'll have this baby wrapped up and be on to the next thing.
