# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 2016-12-30

**Today's Progress**: I went through the FreeCodeCamp jQuery exercises again then started the 'Show the Local Weather' FreeCodeCamp challenge.

So far I have HTML file with a couple of div's and JavaScript file that fetches the [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/current#geo) data with ~~hard coded lat and long values~~

I used [ip-api.com](http://ip-api.com/json) to get my geo data which I have struggled to have a separate functions so now its functions in functions.

**Thoughts**: Not a fan of jQuery, oh wait it's not that bad when it works, but $ this and $ that everywhere and functionception everywhere!

**Up Next**: Work with the JSON data and do some nice stuff with that!
