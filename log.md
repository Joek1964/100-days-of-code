# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 7 : February 28, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Two algorithms solved in one day, in less than 90 minutes. First I solved the 'Sum All Numbers in a Range' getting the max and min value in an array, then I made a while loop to sum in each iteration the values. Second algorithm was 'Diff Two Arrays' and I solved using some If Else conditions to see the largest array and find for values in each array, 'indexOf' function it was a good deal to loop through the arrays.

### Day 6 : February 27, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today I get started my Intermediate Algorithm Scripting on freeCodeCamp working to sum all numbers in a range by arrays as arguments. I get stuck in some parts because I was thinking about some solutions to solve it, but I didn't get success. I read and implemented some javascript functions like 'Math.max()' and 'Math.min()' to get the minimum and maximum values.

**Thoughts** Withou success at this day I kept going forward!

### Day 5 : February 26, 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished the Twitch Web App giving some style but I'm not satisfied yet, so before I finish my Front End Curriculum I'll improve that.

**Thoughts** Design requires experience and creativity, so it is necessary to read more, learn with other different projects, get new ideas and apply it.

### Day 4 : February 24, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Learning more from React.js fundamentals, how to create components, to implement it and create child components with their parents. I learned how to change and execute the programm in production and not, ran webpack to bundle everything in one file to be transformed by Babel.

**Thoughts** I was motivated but I need to handle the time and set especific time.

### Day 3: February 23, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished the functional part of my Twitch App. It required to think more about to get the data for each case like all streamers, only online and offline. The first two cases it was easy to complete, but the offline case I needed to think more, and I solved get a json value, replacing part of a string for a string I wanted and send it as an URL with getJSON function. It WORKED! Now, I need to improve and UX and UI giving style, testing in different devices with Google Developer Tools, etc.
Also, I'm studying and learning React.js with a course of React.js Fundamentals. It's nice, I'm liking, it's JavaScript, but a little bit different with a different style, so sometimes it is confusing to understand functions, objects or methods. And of course, as a new tool, the team behind has created new concepts like JSX that is a function to render HTML inside JavaScript.

**Thoughts** Sometimes it is necessary remember old stuffs, and to be creative with solutions. I did it! I thought don't finish the functional part today.

### Day 2: February 22, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through more one time in my Twitch App Project on FreeCodeCamp. This time I settled a switch case for all, online and offline streamers case. For each case I get the JSON using getJSON function iterating with a for loop. Also, each case is activated when the user choose a nav-tab, so it is necessary change the nav using jQuery.

**Thoughts** Read and Search and implement it. Take a time, think more, make mistakes but save your code before :)

### Day 1: February 21, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through my Twitch App Project on FreeCodeCamp. I get stuck applying the same solution for a different problem. So, I tried a different solution and it is working. Next, I'll use jQuery to activatethe nav-tabs and filter the streamers channels.

**Thoughts** Try different solutions for problems you think that same solution it'll works!

### Day 0: February 20, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Condition If Else implemented in my Twitch App to verify if JSON is null or not but it's not working. Maybe the forEach function or $getJSON can be asyn while it interating the array.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with getJSON function to the get the data at the same time. I need to see how to fix it to make my app works!
