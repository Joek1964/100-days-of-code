# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 7th, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Finished the last 52% of the Applied Accessabilty portion of FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design track

**Thoughts:** I have not practiced coding in a while and so it was tough starting off in the middle of the section like that.


### Day 2: June 8, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
