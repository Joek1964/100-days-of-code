# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 04, 2021
<--##### (delete me or comment me out)-->

**Today's Progress**: Continued working towards having the responsive web design certification from freeCodeCamp: Applied Visual Design.

**Thoughts:** I have very big procastination problems and while i was scrolling through twitter(..and I was quite new to twitter) and I saw posts with #100daysofcode and i just why not try it though I never knew what it was alot(I knew just the basic rule: code for 1 hour a  day). I know this challenge is just work on my programming, no procastination and all and then see something fruitful come out of it.

**Today's Progress**: worked on a memory game with just javascript

**Thoughts**: And yes i followed a tutorial. At this point I still did not know the rules and i was excited. But I think was cool though and it still took me a lot of work to do this.

### Day 3: September 06, 2021

**Today's Progress**: made my own Whack a Mole or Whack Sonic game.

**Thoughts** I definitely had more fun while making this game, I don't think I slept much that night that's how much i wanted it to work so i could play it. 
Through this game, I was able to practice what i learnt from the Responsive Web Design course by freeCodeCamp and it looks good to me.
What i also wanted to do on this game was add a highscore list but i don't know how to that

### Day 4: September 07, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Applied Visual Design phase of the responsive web design by freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** Finally I read the rules on the 100daysofcode challenge on github(I'm still a beginner on github and I had some problems with it plus a lot of data problems in my area). I also read an article by Alex Kallaway,https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-get-a-developer-job-in-less-than-a-year-c27bbfe71645/ and  decided I was going to choose a project and start working on it.So expect the best of me from day 5.
