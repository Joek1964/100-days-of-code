# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I decided to start from beginning. I did a few exercises on freeCodeCamp ([Basic HTML and HTML5](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/)), downloaded my solution, and changed the project to be a dog page. (Cats are really cute but I'm more a dog person üê∂)

**Thoughts:** Doing those exercises was funny and it made me remember the joy of my first steps in the programming world. I'm proud of myself for starting this challenge but I need to remember that I can't spend much time with basic stuff. It's a challenge after all!
