**Today's Progress**: Started the Responsive Web Design curriculum on FreeCodeCamp. Worked on Add imgs, Link to external pages, Link to internal section of page w/ anchor element.

**Thoughts:** I already took some courses on HTML, but this is a good review. Was distracted towards the end, but did end up taking good notes to be able to refer back to whenever.
