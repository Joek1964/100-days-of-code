**Today's Progress**: Today I got an hour to polish my calendar viewer that I wrote about a few days ago. It still has a long way to go but now it's usable enough for my needs.
I've added a github action to deploy it, and fixed some onboarding issues.

**Thoughts**: I needed to revisit date handling, but now it has a proper onboarrding experrience for newcomers. Mobile view is still a mess.
