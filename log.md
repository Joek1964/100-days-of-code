# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 6, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Cleaned up the "Add Contact" phone number input to something a bit more acceptable by just requiring the 10 digit phone number. Also got some progress done on the move to MVVM and the early-end-to-call-queue feature. 

**Thoughts**: I still can't help but think that something like React-Native might be a bit better suited for this project. There are several reasons for this, such as the fact that React-Native is just simply more in demand right now than Xamarin seems to be. I also think that as a general statement, I have more skills with JavaScript than any other programming language at the moment. As such, tomorrow might be the first day that I work on learning React (not native), and then move on from there.

### Day 2: August 7, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started learning React by following along an Udemy course.

**Thoughts**: I feel like I'm just starting, so I don't really have all of that much to talk about. Thus far, it seems pretty simple. I'm glad that I am going to be picking up some experience with ES6, though.


### Day 3: August 8, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Reviewing SQL and Microsoft SQL Server in preperation for an interview on Friday. 

**Thoughts**: Being super honest, I kind of wish I was working with React tonight. I might be able to do some yet, but the chances of that aren't looking fantastic.
