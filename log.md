### Day 0: December 12, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Added Log!

**Thoughts:** Yes, weak sauce is weak. Right now I'm trying to avoid coasting on Github, and hopefully this will encourage that. I have some stuff I've been meaning to work on with Interactive Fiction and Data Analytics -- really, an excuse to play in R - and if nothing else I could use the kick in the pants.

**Today's Progress:** Started! 

**Thoughts:** Working on debugging the header on the Last Res0rt comic site. Caching issues at Cloudflare seem to be affecting my ability to make changes, though.

### Day 5: December 17, 2017

... Darn. I'm pretty sure this counts as a "failed round", but I'd rather keep going anyway and use it as a practice run. Part of what I'm dealing with / working on is issues of perfectionism, so the last thing I want to do is throw in the towel just because things fucked up a little. ðŸ˜¤

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
