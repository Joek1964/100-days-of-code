# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 5: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I re-doing my work create a good code with functions. I have a functional code, but it is a big mess, dind't work when I need handle more. So, today it was more a day to understand the methods, objects e functions. I'm doing very well, for while my progress it is the same, but improving my code and my understanding.

**Thoughts:** I'm ok, I'm like a newbie understand more again, and read, and read. It's better than just read, try it, if works, move forwad. No, I need hack the way I get the knowledge. It's the best way for in the future, DONT BACK AGAIN.

### Day 4: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today, I handle all the data from JSON, but all my code is a confusion, and it is difficult to make some changes and update the HTML when it is necessary. I take off the bootstrap toggle plugin, because it was not working to set some text inside the toggle using JQuery. I deleted the convert temp functions and I'm doing in the variables, it's awful. But, I'm display the data on the page, so it's means I understand how it works, now. So, I will re-do my work creating especific funcionts and call them when necessary. I noticed the page was slow to update all the data. I need to know, why.

**Thoughts:** Today I coded for more than a hour, I'm happy with my progress, it's being slow, but I like. I get stuck just for some minutes, besides, I was tired.

### Day 3: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I'm yet working in my FCC project, it is taking more time than I expected, but it is ok. Finally I handled the JSON from OpenWeather API using getJSON and acessing them as objects. I'm working with some functions, like to get the JSON and others to convert the data as temperature in C or F. Now, I need to display the data in the right place on the page, set some style following an UX. I found out a bootstrap toggle that's a bootstrap pluguin the converts checkboxes in toggles. I'll use to change the temperature to C or F.

**Thoughts:** I read an article on the repository about get dark in code that helped me to come back to work and understand why sometimes it is difficult. I lost one day, so add more one in my track to follow the rules. Now, I see it is not easy to anyone finish or complete something. I get some troubles to understand functions, methods and objects again. I wanted to manipulate functions and methods more easy. The way it is showed or the statement it is a little difficult to get at some time.

### Day 2: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I did a small progress in my web app project on FCC. I just set the openweather API correctly and getted the JSON that I'm displaying on my page. Now I need to handle the JSON to complete the user stories.

**Thoughts:** When you have many tasks for to do, it is difficult to handle the time and sit down to code. I get stuck more one time, but I did in the last of the night. I did!

### Day 1: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I created a function to get the geolocation after read and understand the API, and another function to get the JSON from the API openweathermap. Also, I studied a little of the bootstrap documentation to set the jumbotron class as a card of my web app. I organized my code with some containers and <div>'s. With some inspiration to style the app it will look cool in some commits.

**Thoughts:** I notice the first part is start the day, but when you make that differently everyday with some motivation about "I need to improve, I need to fight with myself to be better". It was necessary read the APIs documentation again again and remember how works a method, a function, a jQuery handle, and you think if you are good enough to make the job. But when you see it is necessary to come back some steps to go up. Wow, it's awesome.

### Day 0: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I get the geolocation from the browser and I tested the openweather API for my project on FCC.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with JavaScript and JQuery, why? Because I've stopped for a long time without code anything. It's a piss off, really. Don't do that. Now, I need to recover again, study more to understand what I'm missing.

**Link to work:** I will up my repo for my GitHub.
