# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 18, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Built structure (HTML) for a form page.

**Thoughts:** I felt this was quite easy. The only challenging part was what HTML attributes to use while creating the form page. I realized the CSS won't be this easy though.

** Coding time: ** Around 1 hour.
