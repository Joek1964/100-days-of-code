# 100 Days of Code: IvesNoIdea's Log

## Day 1 of 100: 3rd January 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on personal web page

**Thoughts:** The coding is OK, it's Git that's...well...a git! I can't figure out how to make it apply my CSS to my HTML. Also, when I create a new branch locally, and make some commits on it, then try to push it to the remote, I get a fatal error. I need to do more research to figure these problems out.

## Day 2 of 100: 4th January 2017

**Today's Progress** I don't want to say this too loudly and jinx myself, but...today has gone pretty well. Maybe it's because I forced myself to focus on one small area - laying out the bare bones of my website - rather than thinking about all surrounding fancy stuff. Tomorrow's aim is to figure out how to apply CSS to my GitHub page. But for today, I'm heading back over to FreeCodeCamp to carry on with my JavaScript tutorials.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
