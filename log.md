# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Introduction**:Before I had started the challenge, I've started working on a personal website/blog, mostly to learn about Python Django Framework. I've only done one tutorial on it - available on Django's primary website. Otherwise, I've been "winging" it.


### Day 0: April 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've managed to get a relationship established between a "post" and a "category" on a personal blog. Reading through documentation and and taking what I've learned about models have really helped me get it established. I've also designed the blog-details html/css document to my liking.


**Thoughts:** As I approach more harder concepts within Django, I'll need to rely on examples and resources about the topic in much more detail. I'd like to get the website setup and live when I learn appropriate deployment methods and more about python-twitter compatible APIs.

**Link to work:** Not yet... :c
