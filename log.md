# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 28th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Cleaned up an old html email, and started a responsive version using Cerberus. [Committed to Github](https://github.com/christinavoudouris/responsive-emails).

**Thoughts:** Feeling less overwhelmed by the project and seeing how helpful the notes in the template are.

**Link(s) to work:** https://responsive-emails.netlify.app
