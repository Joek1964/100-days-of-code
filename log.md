| 05  | 12/22/1018 | Did a debugging kata in PostgreSQL, C, Coffeescript, & PHP                                 | none                                                                                                                          | [CodeWars Solutions Page](https://www.codewars.com/users/lalaithan/completed_solutions)                                    |
| 04  | 12/21/2018 | Not the best day but got a JavaScript kata in. Can't tell you how I solved it.             | I've finally learned (& am applying this!) that doing crappy code on crappy days is going to help me more than doing nothing. | [CodeWars Solutions Page](https://www.codewars.com/users/lalaithan/completed_solutions)                                    |
| 03  | 1218//2018 | Successfully did a kata on codewars.com in each language I am familiar with except for R   | I like CodeWars a whole lot more than I expected!                                                                             | [CodeWars Solutions Page](https://www.codewars.com/users/lalaithan/completed_solutions)                                    |
| 02  | 12/17/2018 | Did a kata on codewars.com, learned about JS math library                                  | I don't know why I'm surprised at the math JS could do, but I am fascinated.                                                  | [CodeWars Solutions Page](https://www.codewars.com/users/lalaithan/completed_solutions)                                    |

>## Day 10: August 20, 2018
>**Today's Progress:** Set up XAMPP on my local computer and installed WordPress.
>**Thoughts:** Different from when I used LAMP but it's not a bad thing. Next session, I need to fix an error with the Easy WP SMTP plugin not sending text emails.
>**Links to work:** I used [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdvVKywGlc0) to set up XAMP on my Windows 10 system.
>## Day 9: August 15, 2018
>**Today's Progress:** Completed FreeCodeCamp's Applied Accesibility and Responsive Web Design Principle challenges.
>**Thoughts:** Nearly done with the Responsive Web Design challenges for FreeCodeCamp!
>**Links to work:** [freeCodeCamp Public Portfolio page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/lalaithan)
>## Day 8: August 14, 2018
>**Today's Progress:** Completed FreeCodeCamp's Applied Vis>  * ual Design section and moved onto Applied Accesibility leaving off at "Add an Accessible Date Picker".
>**Thoughts:** I feel like making several small goals will improve my working habits. I did four Pomodoros today and can do so much more but I was losing momentum at the end. I like seeing progress visually I find, like FreeCodeCamp does with their curriculum page.
>**Links to work:** [freeCodeCamp Public Portfolio page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/lalaithan)
>## Day 7: August 13, 2018
>**Today's Progress:** I did some FreeCodeCamp work in the Responsive Web Design section (*Create a Gradual CSS Linear Gradient, Use a CSS Linear Gradient to Create a Striped Element, Create Texture by Adding a Subtle Pattern as a Background Image, Use the CSS Transform scale Property to Change the Size of an Element, Use the CSS Transform scale Property to Scale an Element on Hover, Use the CSS Transform Property skewX to Skew an Element Along the X-Axis, Use the CSS Transform Property skewY to Skew an Element Along the Y-Axis*). I worked on trigonometric word problems on Khan Academy in anticipation of moving to computer math more confidently. I also worked on program designing on here and watched more of CS Dojo's playlist on algorithms.
>**Thoughts:** I probably did something yesterday but I can't figure out what I did. So embarassing. I'm calling it out here because I can do better.

>## Day 6: August 11, 2018
>**Today's Progress:** I've been reading a textbook on design and logic for any kind of programming or development called [Prelude to Programming](https://smile.amazon.com/Prelude-Programming-Concepts-Pearson-Computer/dp/0132167395/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1534093230&sr=8-2&keywords=prelude+to+programming&dpID=51AVYA7Mj6L&preST=_SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch), 5th edition. I've been skipping what I knew well but I just finished studying the chapter called "Developing a Program" and am developing a personalized flow of working for my own work. Also completed some precalculus review on Khan Academy in anticipation of doing some elementary calculus for algorithms and watched some more of CS Dojo's playlist on algorithms.
>**Thoughts:** Will continue studying the textbook, Khan Academy, and watching [CS Dojo's "Data Structures and Algorithms playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBZBJbE_rGRV8D7XZ08LK6z-4zPoWzu5H). I switched sessions on the MOOC to a later session due to not being able to work on it. I am thinking of doing some of the SQL course on Khan Academy as well.

>## "Day" 5: August 10, 2018
>**Today's Progress:** Had no access to a computer for work other than SoloLearn exercises on my phone. I'm using this to share my notes from my learning. Continuing my Responsive Web Design MOOC, the topics were web design-focused as in:
>* User experience and usability comes before any code
>* __Navigation__
>  * Sitemaps or hierarchies (_Answer: Where can I go?_)
>  * "Breadcrumbs" (_Answer: Where am I?_)
>* __Layout__ (_Answer: What is here?_)
>* __Accessibility__
>  * Web Access Initiative - <https://www.w3.org/WAI/>
>* Dark patterns - <https://www.darkpatterns.org/>
>* Understand why users are going to the website
>* BE SIMPLE
>* BE CONSISTENT
>* DONâ€™T OBFUSCATE
>* __Two basic design approaches__
>  * _[Cognitive/evidence-based](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/)_
>   * What is the information? How do we make the information clear?
>  * _[User-centric](https://www.w3.org/WAI/redesign/ucd)_
>   * Who are our users? What do they want? How do they get the information?
>**Thoughts:** I've come up with a small list of things to go over daily. Right now my list is:
>* [ ] Programming paradigms
>* [ ] Databases
>* [ ] Algorithms & data structures
>* [ ] Actual programming/developing
>* [ ] Computer-related math
>**Links to work:** n/a
> ### Day 4: July 26-27, 2018
>**Today's Progress:** I worked on some JavaScript for the Coursera course I am taking.
>**Thoughts:** I don't know why the quizzes/tests show the answers after one try. Seems lame.
>**Links to work:** n/a
>## Day 3: July 24, 2018
>**Today's Progress:** I chose a C++ code challenge from SoloLearn's collection and spent some time refreshing myself on C++ code. I have only made one obvious adjustment due to time constraints and I think I need to make some adjustments to VS Code for some errors.
>**Thoughts:** I should probably learn what a rebus is and what it is used for to complete this problem.
>**Links to work:** <https://github.com/lalaithan/SL-fix-the-code-challenge>
>## Day 2: July 23, 2018
>**Today's Progress**: I read about variables,  `if...else`, `Boolean` objects, `slice()` method, and `parseInt()` in the Javascript documentation provided by [DevDocs](https://http://devdocs.io). I am taking a class called Responsive Website Basics provided to Coursera by the University of London, Goldsmiths and these were introduced recently. The example they used to apply these things was an e-reader. Also applied to Lyft for a software engineering job.
>**Thoughts:** I really need to take it easy when applying. Right now, it's very emotionally draining.
>**Link to work:** n/a
>## Day 1: July 22, 2018
>**Today's Progress**: I updated a Python script for deleting old Tweets on Twitter to allow for the change in file formats (CSV to JSON) as can be seen in [this repository](https://github.com/lalaithan/delete-tweets) of mine. I was lead to this script from [the Medium article by Quincy Larson](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-delete-your-past-tweets-in-bulk-and-for-free-save-yourself-from-your-past-self-f8844cdbda2) detailing steps on deleting Tweets.
>**Thoughts:** I wanted to start logging my work again to be more organized as to what I'm working on and what I've forgotten or neglected. I can't promise EVERY day, but I am going to be a better programmer with this set up!
