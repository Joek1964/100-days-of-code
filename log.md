# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did a GitHub tutorial, did some Javascript FreeCodeCamp lessons.

**Thoughts:** I wasn't going to commit to #100DaysOfCode right away because I had other things I wanted to do first.  But if not now, when?  I feel pretty good about what I learned in GitHub and FreeCodeCamp.

### Day 2: December 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More Javascript FreeCodeCamp lessons.

**Thoughts:** Feeling a little weird about doing lessons instead of working on my codepen projects, especially given that I have not finished one of the projects.  But getting back into the swing of daily coding is important, and it's what I can do right now.  Should feel good about that.  I know I'll return to codepen to finish at some point soon.

### Day 3: January 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More Javascript FreeCodeCamp lessons.

**Thoughts:** Did an hour of FreeCodeCamp while Maggie drove from VA to NC.  Felt good to do the work.  But I also realize that, for someone like me with a background in C and C++, this stuff is a good refresher but remedial.  The hard part will be writing actual code.  Also, after an hour in the car looking at a computer screen, followed by 4 hours of driving, I'm kind of feeling car sick.

### Day 4: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More Javascript FreeCodeCamp lessons.  Investigated boilerplate code based on freecodecamp blog post.

**Thoughts:** Did less than an hour of exercises in FreeCodeCamp, plus some reading and reviewing of boilerplate for bootstrap.  I keep looking for the shortcut, but I think the answer is to go back to my codepen project and really work on it.  I'm feeling like I'm kind of making progress by doing lessons instead of finishing the Bootstrap program, but really I'm wasting time because I'm not really focusing on making my code work.

### Day 5: January 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More Javascript FreeCodeCamp lessons, with some coding this time.  Also did Safari BootStrap video course while riding bike.  Good overview, I have a better understanding.

**Thoughts:** The JavaScript exercises were good. They required actual coding.  Still kind of review but at least it was real coding.  The BootStrap course from Safari was interesting.  Showed some good concepts, but I'm still not sure I can replicate the capability in CodePen.  I need to either design up front, then implement in CodePen, or dramatically simplify my CodePen design.  I think it's too early to try to use Atom and the browser developer tools.  Need to learn the simplified CodePen environment first.  I'm happy that I gave myself permission to code during work hours today.  But I need to commit to more significant project coding if I'm really going to get enything out of this.

### Day 6: January 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More Javascript FreeCodeCamp lessons.  Only a half hour.

**Thoughts:** I got a lot done today, but I didn't get a full hour in.

### Day 7: January 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More Javascript FreeCodeCamp lessons.  Getting into dynamically creating and managing large data objects.  This is really cool stuff, there's a lot I can do with it.

**Thoughts:** First, these data objects are great.  I never really got good enough with C++ to use them, but I love the idea based on what I'm learning in JavaScript.  I'm getting inspired to create the data models for my chat bot.  The deal chat bot should be implementable straight from these coding principles.  Also, listening to some of my old coding tunes while coding was fun.  Brought back memories and got me pumped.

### Day 8: January 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Did a lot of stuff today, but none of it was coding.

**Thoughts:** Thought about coding all day but had a lot to do and ran out of gas before I got to coding.

### Day 9: January 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished a couple of FreeCodeCamp exercises, but got stuck on the syntax for accessing multi-dimensional arrays.  

**Thoughts:** I learned a lot and it was a good experience to work my way through the exercise, but it was also very frustrating because I've made such great progress in the past with these exercises.  I know this is a new capability that I don't have a background in, so I can't rely as much on past experience, but it's still frustrating knowing I didn't get all the way there.  I didn't look at the answer (assuming it's written somewhere in the hint section, like it often is).  But if I can't get some help I'll peek so that I can move on.  I know I'm close enough that my logic is sound, and once I learn the syntax I likely won't forget it.

### Day 10: January 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished @FreeCodeCamp JavaScript exercises and made good headway into Object Oriented and Functional programming.  Kids started interrupting me and I got to a point where I was guessing at syntax from context clues rather than learning the material to pass the tests.  So I'm giving it a rest for tonight. 

**Thoughts:** I feel really good about what I've learned for JavaScript and the OOP stuff.  It's really compelling to me and very energizing.  I also watched a video series on Bootstrap today while riding my bike.  All of the stuff makes sense, and I'm sure with adequate time to learn the tools and concepts, I'll be able to do some really interesting stuff.  So I'll focus on using Bootstrap to upgrade my basic portfolio site to get practice with Bootstrap.  My goal will be to get a basic mastery of simple, functional front-end UI design.  Then I'll focus on algorithms.  I keep getting drawn to deep learning and AI, and specifically the study group.  Tney meet weekly on Sundays, and at other times as well.  Socially and content-wise, it really looks compelling.  The basic coursework includes setting up AWS server images, so I'm also intrigued with the notion that I can learn how to set up AWS environments.

### Day 11: January 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Got some things done today, but too many to-dos and I didn't get to do any coding.   

**Thoughts:** I feel like I've done zero hours, then 2+ hours for a couple of cycles now.  I'm not overly concerned, and I've certainly stayed with the commitment.  But I don't want to make this a habit.  There was no emergency that kept me from coding.

### Day 12: January 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent several hours on training and coding.  Great progress and more than made up for no coding yesterday.  I watched a coding course on FaceBook Analytics.  It has a full project write-up on Jupyter, with code on GitHub.  I also researched Jupyter, and some of the other architectural patterns that the presenting team pointed me to.  I also finished the Object Oriented and Functional Programming lessons in FreeCodeCamp and did several coding exercises.  I also looked up how to use console.log and got it working so that I could debug my code.

**Thoughts:** The training I did is a little past my current skill level, but very useful to know once I get a little farther down the learning path.  It was definitely inspiring to see that these frameworks exist, and I'm confident (maybe overconfident?) that I'll be well enough trained to use them soon.  The coding went exceptionally well.  I had expected to hit some stumbling blocks as I went through the last OOP exercises and got into the coding exercises, but things went very smoothly.  I really need to commit a little more time by coding every day.  I'm feeling  confident that I'll be able to start doing project work if I keeo at this.

### Day 13: January 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent some time on a coding exercise to see if a string was a Palindrome.  I spent a lot more time than technically necessary because I really wanted to explore different ways of solving the problem, rather than falling back on my non-OOP thinking. But I ended up using a couple of JavaScript methods and a for loop.  Ho hum.

**Thoughts:** It felt good to get through the code today.  This was, by far, the most complex code I'd done to date, and the first coding exercise that required me to do research and use the debugger.  So it was satisfying to get to the end.  My biggest problem (as it was when I was younger) is that I don't remember to be 100% consistent when I fix my code.  So I end up leaving bugs.  I don't update every instance of a variable when I make a change, or I have off-by-one errors.  Other people seem to be able to keep track of everything in their heads and write down what they need.  I make small mistakes that create big problems.  I'll need to think about code quality at some point.

### Day 14: January 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made huge progress on freecodecamp basic algorithm programming.  I spent a fair amount of time really testing and debugging my code to understand the context and syntax of the commands.  I went through something like 10 exercises, which is great progress.  They took me anywhere from 5 minutes to over an hour per exercise.  There was one that involved complex string manipulation in which I understood the context but couldn't get the code syntax right.  That one was the only one where I pasted in code.

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling very motivated and very productive.  I know I've just scratched the surface, and when I get to the projects I'll need to dig more into the methods and properties that I've missed or skimmed.  But I feel like I'm knocking the rust off my logic skills, and I'm learning syntax and structure in Javascript.  I'm looking forward to getting to the front end development projecdts.  I know I have a lot of work to do to get there, but with consistent effort to retain what I've learned and make steady progress, I think I'll be able to start becoming productive in creating web apps.

### Day 15: January 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I did a couple of exercises, but I got bogged down in "higher order" functions and "callback functions".  Specifically, filter, map, and reduce functions.  It's an amazing capability that I need to slow down and master.  

**Thoughts:** I got fairly frustrated with learning filter, map, and reduce.  I couldn't make sense of the supporting material on the web because there are several ways to implement higher order functions and I couldn't tie them together.  Also, the descriptions were very jargony.  I could solve the exercises with cumbersome for loops, and I've succeeded at that, but I decided really need to slow down and master this stuff the right way before moving on.  Partly because these functions are very powerful and I can picture using them a lot.  And partly because JSON and AJAX are coming up next, and I know they make a lot of use of higher order functions.  So I'd rather slow down a little now to avoid getting much more slowed down when I move forward.

### Day 16: January 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent the day studying object oriented programming (OOP).  Watched a 2 hour video series on OOP for JavaScript, which was very detailed and technical.  First hour I rode my bike while watching, which helped me get some exercise.  I spent several hours studying this stuff, and it seems to be coming to me slowly.  But I still don't understand the syntax yet.

**Thoughts:** It's less frustrating as I start to understand how complex and new this way of thinking is.  I get the complexity of writing code this way, and that the advantages and pitfalls of coding this way are very different from the procedural coding I'm used to.  I realize I need to take this slowly, work through it, and use it for all the freeCodeCamp exercises moving forward.  I may have to do some training on the side to understand the advantages and pitfalls of specicific approaches as I go.  I can't rely on my past experience because it's procedural in nature.

### Day 17: January 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I happened across an open browser tab that had the answer to my original question on OOP syntax.  I didn't understand OOP when I first did the search, so I didn't recognize the answer when I saw it.  Having spent most of the last couple of days studying, and coming fresh after a good night's sleep today, it made sense.  I'm still writing my notes but will apply this answer to my exercises and see if I can start moving forward on the FreeCodeCamp Exercises.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited by the possibilities but still a bit overwhelmed trying to make progress.  I can see the potential of OOP for JavaScript for what I'm trying to do, and I'm definitely out of my comfort zone.  But I can tell I'm learning, meaning that the potential I see is valid, and eventually I'll master it.  As frustrating as it is to be taking so much time to learn, I'm making progress and I feel good about my ability to ask myself good questions and direct my inquiry to get to good answers.  Instead of simply trying to find the correct syntax to complete an exercise, I'm taking the time to understand the context and committing to using it going forward.

### Day 18: January 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I did some thinking about my project but I didn't code.  Got busy with other things.  I think I was also a little mentally exhausted because of all the hours I've spent recently learning about OOP concepts.  I just needed a break, and to focus on some other priorities.

**Thoughts:** Coding seems daunting today.  I'm still very motivated to continue, but realizing how much I have to learn in order to feel good about moving forward just feels like a lot.  I also recognize that I have to reset my priorities and expectations in order to do this right.  I can try to "brute force" my way through the freeCodeCamp lessons and coding exercises, trying to rely on my procedural coding skills, but I know that approach will ultimately fail.  I need the mental energy to take on this new learning experience, and I don't have it today.

### Day 19: January 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I decided to go back through all the freeCodeCamp exercises that I've completed, and study the "get a hint" solutions in detail for the exercises I've already completed.  The first exercise I looked at, I had the same solution but the "get a hint" code was more optimal.  I learned a good lesson there, and it was quick.  The second exercise was written as a recursive function instead of a loop.  I spent a lot of time researching this approach, and I really need to spend enough time that I can make good use of it.  It may take a long time to get through these exercises.

**Thoughts:** I feel great about the learning I'm doing.  I really feel like it's useful, and it's stuff that I'm good at and passionate about.  But I worry that I'll get bogged down, and that I won't be able to produce anything useful for years.  I have so many other commitments that I can't focus on this full time.  I need to stay focused on the good feeling of learning and growing, and set shorter term goals, and let the long term work itself out.

### Day 20: January 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent some time watching a video course on Immutability.  Very cool, opened my eyes to approaches that are way past my procedural code background.  Also went through a couple of the freeCodeCamp exercises that I'd completed procecdurally and tried to them functionally.  I got a few bits right, mostly wrong, but I learned some things by trying before I looked at the answers.

**Thoughts:** The question is how to proceed from here.  I really love the concepts I'm learning, but how best to retain and appluy them?  Do a bunch of short programs and hope I use them?  Take good notes and develop a style guide?  Pseudocode a project big enough to take into account all of the concepts and code, then refactor over time as I learn more?  I was really impressed with MineSweeper, maybe I should design a game to test my skills.  Or a game that simulates my deal model.  I really need to figure out how to capture this stuff.  I also feel like work is getting in the way of this stuff, but at the same time, I don't want to take time off and spend 8 hours a day on this stuff.  I need to learn in smaller bites and process the knowledge.
