# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked through several user stories, features and bugs on portfolio.

**Thoughts:** Felt really good to break things into small pieces and knock them off one by one. Left with an issue getting image to hide on small displays with bootstrap. HTML is formatted terrible. Need to figure out linting I think.

**Time: 1 hour 40 minutes

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added image to portfolio and hid it when screens size is small. Added blurb in about section. These both need some improvement, but they are both there.

**Thoughts**: I really am enjoying this daily practice. I am going to read through all the Bootstrap 4 soon. There are a few changes in classes from Bootstrap 3. I am going to read some articles about getting hired as a developer. I am really tired today.

**Time: 1 hour

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
