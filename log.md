# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### "Day" 5: August 10, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Had no access to a computer for work other than SoloLearn exercises on my phone. I'm using this to share my notes from my learning. Continuing my Responsive Web Design MOOC, the topics were web design-focused as in:

* User experience and usability comes before any code
* __Navigation__
  * Sitemaps or hierarchies (_Answer: Where can I go?_)
  * "Breadcrumbs" (_Answer: Where am I?_)
* __Layout__ (_Answer: What is here?_)
* __Accessibility__
  * Web Access Initiative - https://www.w3.org/WAI/
* Dark patterns - https://www.darkpatterns.org/
* Understand why users are going to the website
* BE SIMPLE
* BE CONSISTENT
* DONâ€™T OBFUSCATE
* __Two basic design approaches__
  * _[Cognitive/evidence-based](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/)_
   * What is the information? How do we make the information clear?
  * _[User-centric](https://www.w3.org/WAI/redesign/ucd)_
   * Who are our users? What do they want? How do they get the information?

**Thoughts:** I've come up with a small list of things to go over daily. Right now my list is:

* [ ] Programming paradigms
* [ ] Databases
* [ ] Algorithms & data structures
* [ ] Actual programming/developing
* [ ] Computer-related math

> ### Day 4: July 26-27, 2018

>**Today's Progress:** I worked on some JavaScript for the Coursera course I am taking.

>**Thoughts:** I don't know why the quizzes/tests show the answers after one try. Seems lame.

>**Links to work:** n/a

>### Day 3: July 24, 2018

>**Today's Progress:** I chose a C++ code challenge from SoloLearn's collection and spent some time refreshing myself on C++ code. I have only made one obvious adjustment due to time constraints and I think I need to make some adjustments to VS Code for some errors.

>**Thoughts:** I should probably learn what a rebus is and what it is used for to complete this problem.

>### Day 2: July 23, 2018

>**Today's Progress**: I read about variables,  `if...else`, `Boolean` objects, `slice()` method, and `parseInt()` in the Javascript documentation provided by [DevDocs](https://http://devdocs.io). I am taking a class called Responsive Website Basics provided to Coursera by the University of London, Goldsmiths and these were introduced recently. The example they used to apply these things was an e-reader. Also applied to Lyft for a software engineering job.

>**Thoughts:** I really need to take it easy when applying. Right now, it's very emotionally draining.

>### Day 1: July 22, 2018

>**Today's Progress**: I updated a Python script for deleting old Tweets on Twitter to allow for the change in file formats (CSV to JSON) as can be seen in [this repository](https://github.com/lalaithan/delete-tweets) of mine. I was lead to this script from [the Medium article by Quincy Larson](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-delete-your-past-tweets-in-bulk-and-for-free-save-yourself-from-your-past-self-f8844cdbda2) detailing steps on deleting Tweets.

>**Thoughts:** I wanted to start logging my work again to be more organized as to what I'm working on and what I've forgotten or neglected. I can't promise EVERY day, but I am going to be a better programmer with this set up!
