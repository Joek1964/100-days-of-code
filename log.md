# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 1: November 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished freeCodeCamp "Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5"

**Thoughts:** I will be using C# in Unity and I have a decent teacher for that (my brother). I feel like getting into basics of coding with interactive tutorials will give me perspective and logical thinking useful for game dev as well.

Day 2: November 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished freeCodeCamp "Basic CSS"

**Thoughts:** I had no idea that CSS allows to you change so much with so little work
