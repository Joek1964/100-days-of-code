# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Built a project called "Two Thirds of Average" gotten from [ryanstutorials.net](https://ryanstutorials.net/programming-challenges) with C++. This is my first project with C++.

**Thoughts:** I am finding C++ quite interesting and I think I would love to learn more of it. I used an old editor (DevCpp) and an old version though and that slowed me down. I plan to upgrade soon so I can enjoy learning the language better.
