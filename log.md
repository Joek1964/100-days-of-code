# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 3, 2017 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've trail through the html, css and bootstrap parts on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I've started coding for a year or so, so I have a good foundation in html & css, and need to move forward.

### Day 2: Jan 4, 2017 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've finish bootstrap & jQuery lessons from FreeCodeCamp, and started working on a one page portfolio.

**Thoughts**: I'm currently not fond of the current iteration of bootstrap 4 beta 5 support for flexbox, there was many frustration points today.

### Day 3: Jan 5, 2017 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Making progress on my portfolio, and figure out the padding issue in my nav (because of the ul element).

**Thoughts**: It's still taking too long to finish a one pager and figure out the nooks and cranny about bootstrap 4 beta 5. I hope beta 6 comes out as they removed all the floats, and used flexbox.
