# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 12th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Personal site: Contact icon showing in mobile. Change project links to go to repos. Open projects in new tab. Add Remember me project. Added snapshots of blog and new projects. Pretty much a bunch of clean up. Need to add link to blog site that links back to my personal page.

**Thoughts**: So glad I got feedback on my site. It's looking much better now.
