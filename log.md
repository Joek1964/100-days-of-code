# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 5: May 4, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Finished tribute. 

**Keywords of the day**: iterations! 

**Thoughts** While I have satisfied the user stories, I could most certainly iterate over the project a few more times trying to perfect it, but I think I'll submit this to prevent myself from getting stuck in a perfection loop.

### Day 4: May 3, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Finished up jQuery and started my first coding project. (tribute page)

**Keywords of the day**: jQuery, Read-Search-Ask

**Thoughts** A Project! While not overly complex, I did pause immediately and seem to forget everything I had learned, heh. I have to keep writing code though, I don't need to have it totally figured out in my head first.

### Day 3: May 2, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Continuing through FreeCodeCamp Front end dev. Finished up the bootstrap section, moved into jQuery.

**Keywords of the day**:bootstrap, grid, col, font-awesome, jQuery

**Thoughts** Today was the first time the course allowedd me to try and recall things from memory rather than just giving me the line to nearly directly execute.  So far so good, motivated.

### Day 2: May 1, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Continuing through FreeCodeCamp Front end dev. Spent most of the day working through bootstrap responsive classes.

**Keywords of the day**:
div

CSS
	id #something
	class .something
  padding - internal to element
  margin - space around element
  clockwise notation, just like it sounds :)

  Who wins?
  !important >inline > id > class

Hexidecimal color: black  = #000000

bootstrap helps create responsive web

    btn
    btn-block (complete width, requires btn)
    btn-primary
    btn-info
    btn-danger

span - put several elements together

**Thoughts** Trying to get learning structure established.  I imagine the next couple of days I'll be adjusting these logs and how I take notes for better reflection and use.

### Day 1: April 30, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I started working through the FreeCodeCamp front end developer curriculum.

### Day 0: April 29, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I've created all of the neccesary accounts as well as stood up my Ubuntu dev environment.

**Thoughts** Feels awesome to get organized and start down this path. It's going to take some effort to keep from being distracted between learning at work and here.
