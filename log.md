# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I have completed pending Basic CSS lessons and commenced Advanced Visual Design lessons.

**Thoughts**: I feel great resuming the FreeCodeCamp curriculum with a fresh determination and commitment to _go all the way_.

### Day 2: January 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I have come across two html tags that I had never known about before; tag u for undelining text and s for striking throuh text.

**Thoughts**: So tired to concentrate on code after traveling almost 9 hours by road.

### Day 3: January 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I covered basic color theory lessons.

**Thoughts**: The lessons I covered today were interesting, however I found it rather boring to write code. I hope to be in better shape tomorrow and increase my tempo on the number of lessons per day.

### Day 4: January 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I covered more color theory, CSS linear gradients, CSS transforms, @keyframes and animation.

**Thoughts**: I had fun working through today's lessons. Am beginning to feel the urge to start practising what am learning by creating hobbyist content on Code Pen.

### Day 5: Janauary 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Cleared Applied Visual Design lessons. Moving on to Applied Accessibility.

**Thoughts**: I took longer than necessary to finish the Applied Visual Design Lessons. I wanted to grasp the concepts.

### Day 6: January 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Done with Applied Acessibility.

**Thoughts**: Am contented with my progress today.
