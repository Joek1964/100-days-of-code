# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 28, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Completely set up component file structure for my react app profile and started to transfer over info from my previous portfolio.

**Thoughts:** It's been about two weeks since school ended. I forgot some basics right off the bat and it's a terrible feeling so I'm glad to be doing this coding challenge. I need to get connected to more people so I can make sure i'm doing things correctly. Being outside the classroom environment is pretty scary but that just means there is plenty of room for growth!

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
