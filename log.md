# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Dec. 29, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Used Visual Basic with Excel in attempt to automate data parsing.

**Thoughts:** This is a mini-assignment from a potential employer. I know nothing about VB and am trying to learn via Lynda.

**Link to work:** NA


### Day 2: Dec. 30, 2016

**Today's Progress**: More work on VB and Excel project.

**Thoughts**: I found some helpful links online about using VB. Tried unsuccessfully to use them in my mini-assignment. Submitted what I had accomplished.

**Link(s) to work**: NA


### Day 3: Dec. 31, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Back to Free Code Camp curriculum.

**Thoughts** I have completed Caesar's Cipher but needed a lot of help. However, I have gotten better at algorithms overall through this section.

### Day 4: Jan. 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed API section of Free Code Camp curriculum.

**Thoughts:** This was basically a copy-paste section and I know I will have to go back over this when I try to implement for real.

**Link to work:** https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/trigger-click-events-with-jquery plus 6 more lessons


### Day 5: Jan. 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Messed around with jQuery and worked on Random Quote Machine. Realized I will use an API for random quotes.

**Thoughts**: Good to review jQuery and rather than hard-coding quotes, decided to try using first API.

### Day 6: Jan. 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Went back over the API instructional section, took notes, and found the free API I want to try.

**Thoughts**: Time-consuming but also time well-spent.

###Day 7: Jan. 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More with API and Random Quote Machine.

**Thoughts**: Read about helpful advice on Free Code Camp forum for implementation. Also Bootstrapped all the HTML and CSS.

###Day 8: Jan. 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Jacked up 100 Days Of Code repo at least twice, so I spent time reviewing Git/GitHub. Also realized I needed to do housekeeping with this Log and to keep commits going to GitHub.

**Thoughts**: If I were pushing code to a central repo and wanting it to be merged, my repo would have been right. Instead I need to just set up and merge my own stuff, like I created my own Algorithms repo.

###Day 9: Jan. 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got $.getJSON and jQuery somewhat working on Random Quote Machine, plus minor CSS changes.

**Thoughts**: How to randomize quotes and not just pull one at a time? How to cycle through API's array? How to get Twitter functionality working?

###Day 10: Jan. 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Saw Hidden Figures and was inspired to keep going with coding. Fortran, anyone?

**Thoughts**: Why am I doing this? What are my motivators?

###Day 11: Jan. 8, 2017
**Day Off**


###Day 12: Jan. 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Scrapped quotes API because I couldn't get it to randomize and return properly. Wrote JavaScript code for an array of quotes which are selected at random one at a time. Will use API for Twitter part of project instead.

**Thoughts**: Frustrated by this project that seems simple but isn't turning out to be. Happy that I got a quote to return at random from an array. Sad that I can't bring it into the view on button click yet.

###Day 13: Jan. 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Code is working for random quotes displaying to view! Helpful advice from Free Code Camp forum.

**Thoughts**: Getting quite an education by going through API documentation for Twitter. Very interesting. Taking notes.

###Day 14: Jan. 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Encouraged others and networked. Making notes on security for tweeting quotes.

**Thoughts**: Glad to make friends online with other coders and developers. Networking is important although outside my comfort zone.

###Day 15: Jan 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Searched for free wireframe tool, downloaded WinSCP to start learning about remote hosting, and read more about Twitter API usage.

**Thoughts**: I need to prioritize. Finish Random Quote Machine in order to post to portfolio. Wireframe for possible part-time job. Both important.

**Link to work**: Twitter documentation, took notes


###Day 16: Jan. 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Twitter API objects, more reading and note-taking. Fascinating!

**Thoughts**: The Twitter database must be vast. So many object properties per account/tweet/entity etc.

**Link to work**: API overview https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api and subsequent section


###Day 17: Jan 14, 2017
**Day Off**

###Day 18: Jan. 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Tweets, Users, Entities, etc. More with API usage.

**Thoughts**: Concerned that it's going to be hard to capture the quote randomly generated and tweet it verbatim to a particular user's Twitter account. So much to think through and much to learn to execute this, probably.
