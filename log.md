# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 4, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: 
I'm building an RGB color game. There will be six squares that will have random colors. Based on the RGB color code shown at the top of the page, the player will be able to guess which is the correct color. The player will be informed whether or not they chose the right color and will have the option to try again. For now, the colors are hard coded. Eventually, a random color will be given and the player will be able to chose which is the correct color of the six colors shown. 

- [x] In HTML, there are six divs with different background colors for each square.
- [x] In CSS, each div is styled with the following properties:
  - background color
  - padding-bottom
  - float
  - margin
  - width
- [x] In JS:
  - An array of six hard coded colors.
  - A hard coded default RGB color value (for now) in the h1 tag.
  - Click event listeners that alerts the player of the color that was clicked on.
 
**Thoughts:** 
I'm glad I was able to start building a color game. However, working in Cloud9 is challenging. I spent quite a bit of time looking for errors when it turns out c9 was the issue.  I may have to go back to using Caret as the text editor on my Chromebook.


### Day 1: December 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
I need variety, so I decided to take a break from the color game and try to get a basic understanding of Docker. The lesson I worked through introduced me to containers, images, dockerfiles and volumes.

**Thoughts:**
I had a hard time understanding the basics when I tried learning Docker in the past. This time around it was easier. Containers and automation are very interesting to me. Iâ€™m glad I took the time to work through a lesson.


### Day 2: December 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
Here's what I worked on:
- [x] If the wrong color is clicked, the color fades to the background color leaving only the remaining possible answers.
- [x] Notification to the player for whether or not the correct color was chosen.
- [x] Changed span color.
- [x] Wrote random number function to generate a random RGB color for each game.

**Thoughts**
This was an interesting day. I spent most of it running from one appointment to the next so I didn't code as much as I wanted to. As the day comes to an end and the fairies temp me with sleep by sprinkling sleepy dust on me, I had to stay focused and code for at least an hour. I did it!

### Day 3: december 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**
- [x] Changed background color for h1.
- [x] Created random number function and removed hard coded RGB color values.
- [x] Wrote a for loop that pushes random color into an empy array.
- [x] Wrote randomColor function that generates random color for each value of RGB.

**Thoughts**
The more I work ont his project the more fun I have and I'm learning a lot.
