# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**  
Tried working on a solution for reversing a string with a while loop. 

**Thoughts**   
I have seen numerous examples of solving this with a for loop, recursion and built-in methods. A while loop may not be the optimal, but I wanted to mix things up to see if it was possible to solve.

### Day 2: July 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**   
Was able to reverse a string with a for loop. Unable to solve recursively(need to get a better
understanding of syntax).

**Thoughts**   
Today I've learned:
* `length` method can be applied to arrays and string
* Javascript follows the _lexical scope_ principle 
  * i.e. in nested functions, the inner function has access to both inner and outer variables. Whereas the outer function only has access to outer variables.

### Day 3: July 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**   
Skiped a day because I fell asleep last nightðŸ˜“. Was unable to reverse a string recursively.   

**Thoughts**     
Kept trying to make my solution similar to a for loop by declaring variables.  
Recursion is sometimes not the most optimal solution, which is true in this case.  

Today I've learned:
* build-in methods `substr()` and `charAt()` are required to solve problem

### Day 4: July 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**   
Attempted _Sock Merchant_ problem from Hacker Rank on *Repl.it* website. Was able to solve for key-paired values sock object.  

**Thoughts**     
Hacker Rank considered this a warmup problem, but it is definetely not for beginners.  

Today I've learned:
* how to create/add key-paired values to an empty object with conditional statement

### Day 5: July 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**   
Attempted to _Sock Merchant_ problem on *Repl.it* again. Was able to target all property values. Was unable to get tally of even pairs of socks to solve problem.

**Thoughts**     
Once I am able to get tally of even pairs, this solution will need to be combined with first solution(key-paired values sock object).

Today I've learned:
* `Object.values` method can be used to return property values within an object

### Day 6: July 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**   
Attempted to solve _Sock Merchant_ problem on *Repl.it* again. Was able to get tally of all even pairs with reduce method.

**Thoughts**     
The `reduce` method is a powerful one and can be used to perform tally-up an object for number of occurence and getting total count of an array. Will attempt to use only `reduce` to arrive at solution.
