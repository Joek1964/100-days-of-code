# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did a GitHub tutorial, did some Javascript FreeCodeCamp lessons.

**Thoughts:** I wasn't going to commit to #100DaysOfCode right away because I had other things I wanted to do first.  But if not now, when?  I feel pretty good about what I learned in GitHub and FreeCodeCamp. 

**Tweet:** R1D1 - Starting #100DaysOfCode Did some FreeCodeCamp Javascript and GitHub tutorial today.  I was a good coder in the 20th century but it's been a couple of decades #OldDogNewTricks

**Link to work:** N/A
