# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created hello-world repository on GitHub, created first edit and pull request, then commited. Created simple JavaScript statements in the Chrome console.

**Thoughts:** ihavenoideawhatimdoing.jpg

### Day 1: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did more JavaScript in the Chrome console. 

### Day 2: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read through the intro of "Automate the Boring Stuff With Python". Installed Python and did a few simple expressions in IDLE.

### Day 3: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started Practical Javascript on watchandcode.com. Starting to build a to-do list.

**Thoughts:** I want to work on getting better at web development, but then I also want to learn some Python for work. "Automate the Boring Stuff" seems really interesting, and would probably help me. I think I'm going to focus on JavaScript for now until I get the syntax down, and to not confuse myself with trying to learn two things at once.

### Day 4: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Hosted a 'Code + Coffee' event. Working on title casing a sentence in JavaScript (FreeCodeCamp Basic Algorithm Scripting #252). The first letter of each word should be uppercase, and the rest of the word should be lowercase. I managed to change the entire string to lowercase (easy enough), but haven't been able to figure out how to make the first letter uppercase yet.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I just stared at the requirements for this project for about an hour. 

### Day 5: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Writing functions in JavaScript (using the Chrome console). 19% complete with Practical Javascript (watchandcode.com)

### Day 6: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working through Practical Javascript. Finished version 2 of a todo list using functions (addTodo, deleteTodo, displayTodo, changeTodo). Moving on to version 3 using objects. 23% done.

### Day 7: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on objects in Practical Javascript. 27% done.

**Thoughts:** A function inside an object is a method.. TI(re)L.

### Day 8: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Still working on objects in JS. Started using Plunker instead of just using the Chrome console. 30% complete.
