# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did a GitHub tutorial, did some Javascript FreeCodeCamp lessons.

**Thoughts:** I wasn't going to commit to #100DaysOfCode right away because I had other things I wanted to do first.  But if not now, when?  I feel pretty good about what I learned in GitHub and FreeCodeCamp.

### Day 2: December 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More Javascript FreeCodeCamp lessons.

**Thoughts:** Feeling a little weird about doing lessons instead of working on my codepen projects, especially given that I have not finished one of the projects.  But getting back into the swing of daily coding is important, and it's what I can do right now.  Should feel good about that.  I know I'll return to codepen to finish at some point soon.

### Day 3: January 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More Javascript FreeCodeCamp lessons.

**Thoughts:** Did an hour of FreeCodeCamp while Maggie drove from VA to NC.  Felt good to do the work.  But I also realize that, for someone like me with a background in C and C++, this stuff is a good refresher but remedial.  The hard part will be writing actual code.  Also, after an hour in the car looking at a computer screen, followed by 4 hours of driving, I'm kind of feeling car sick.

### Day 4: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More Javascript FreeCodeCamp lessons.  Investigated boilerplate code based on freecodecamp blog post.

**Thoughts:** Did less than an hour of exercises in FreeCodeCamp, plus some reading and reviewing of boilerplate for bootstrap.  I keep looking for the shortcut, but I think the answer is to go back to my codepen project and really work on it.  I'm feeling like I'm kind of making progress by doing lessons instead of finishing the Bootstrap program, but really I'm wasting time because I'm not really focusing on making my code work.

### Day 5: January 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More Javascript FreeCodeCamp lessons, with some coding this time.  Also did Safari BootStrap video course while riding bike.  Good overview, I have a better understanding.

**Thoughts:** The JavaScript exercises were good. They required actual coding.  Still kind of review but at least it was real coding.  The BootStrap course from Safari was interesting.  Showed some good concepts, but I'm still not sure I can replicate the capability in CodePen.  I need to either design up front, then implement in CodePen, or dramatically simplify my CodePen design.  I think it's too early to try to use Atom and the browser developer tools.  Need to learn the simplified CodePen environment first.  I'm happy that I gave myself permission to code during work hours today.  But I need to commit to more significant project coding if I'm really going to get enything out of this.
