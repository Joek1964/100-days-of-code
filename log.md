Day 2 and 3 : 

Thoughts: I had been struggling with dynamic programming for 3 days, even after giving abt 6 hours , i could only solve 3 problems. üôÑüòíüòê

Day2 : https://github.com/Manvityagi/100codes/blob/master/%232%20Maximum%20square%20sub-matrix%20of%20all%200s%20%23dp ‚Ä¶


Day3 : https://github.com/Manvityagi/100codes/blob/master/%233%20Longest%20Increasing%20Subsequence ‚Ä¶


Day 4 : Implemented Kruskals algorithm to make a spanning tree

Day 6 :  
Tried hands on string problems:
code 1 : Amazing strings https://github.com/Manvityagi/100codes/blob/master/day6%20%20amazing%20strings 
code 2 : Pangrams
https://github.com/Manvityagi/100codes/blob/master/day6%20pangram
code 3 : remove duplicates
https://github.com/Manvityagi/100codes/blob/master/day7%20RemoveDuplicates


Worked on a few problems of Linked Lists as i have to revise Data Structures this week.
