# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
- Completed the **Getting Started** and **HTML5 and CSS** sections of [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) and started the **Responsive Design with Bootstrap** section. 
- Started building a website for some of my favorite missionaries.

**Thoughts:** The FreeCodeCamp sections were mostly review but there were a few nuggets of new information. Bootstrap is new and fun to learn.
