# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Jan 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

- Started setting up the lambda server for brain of my bot.
- Created an endpoint to return true or false if progress log.md (this file) was updated with today's progress.

**Thoughts:** Setup Python3 env, Zappa and basic Flask App. Feels like it took 1.5 hrs to just setup and play with simple github API, need to improve my speed. Refactored logic and simplified requirements in second pass
