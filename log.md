# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 0: September 06, 2023
Today's Progress: Start working on a School Library Testing part in Ruby using RSpec. Thoughts: I really struggled with the unit test, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Ruby is still new to me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

Today's Progress: Continued working on a School Library Testing part in Ruby using RSpec. Thoughts: I really struggled with the unit test, but, today I've finished testing all the classes and it is passing 100%. Ruby is still new to me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

Day 2: September 08, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I've started to contribute to the first collaboration and solve some algorithms.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent. And the great thing is I write a test first before starting to implement the code
