# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 22, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I started my programming time by doing day 06 of Javascript 30 which took just over an hour from start to finish. Today's project was a search box that when typed in, it would show a list of suggested cities and states based on the input. It was a nice refresher for fetching data and how to transform and use it in the content of the page only using vanilla javascript instead of something like react. After I finished (and ate lunch) I added the README file to the project and pushed it to github with the finished project code. When that was done, I spent about 20 minutes working on the HackerRank 10 days of js. I did 03 of the challenges which had me work with creating objects, counting objects, and creating classes which was not something I have a ton of experience doing so I was able to add that to my study list.

**Thoughts**:
