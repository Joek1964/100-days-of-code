# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 28th 2024

**Today's Progress**: I have started to work on some of my old projects that i had left dormant. Coder’s camp is my first challenge. I spent today trying to figure out how i can implement Bootstrap Responsiveness into my already built website. 

**Thoughts:** I really struggled to understand how to implement Bootstrap responsiveness into my already built webpage without making my code look messy. This is something I’m currently still working on but i have hope i will come to understand it a lot better by looking at further resources apart from the Bootstrap documentation provided on their website.
