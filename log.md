### Day 0: March 20, 2019 (Test)
##### (Setting up thing to work)

**Today's Progress**: <!--Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.--> 
  Read from the webiste [100daysofCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) Rules, resources, videos etc

**Thoughts:**  
  Got to know the rules of the challenge and the primary goal of this challenge. Every little bit of progress needs aplomb. Even a small step is progress. Focus on the positve.

### Day 1: March 21, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Reached out to two ppl on twitter  [@EvanEichelberg2](https://twitter.com/@EvanEichelberg2)  [@cvillafraz](https://twitter.com/@cvillafraz) 
                      The challenge seems to only do projects. Lets do those projects then. 
                      Although projects are the preffered drug and will ensure the maximum learning, 
                      FCC exercises are also counted as time spent coding. 
                      Spending time on FCC even counts. I also used exercism and it took me loads of time to set it up, a tedious start.
                      

**Thoughts** Not focusing on one thing at a time cost time and effort, its harder to focus on one thing when there are so many opportunities out there but the thing is use one resource and learn well from it. Not starting a project gave a miserable taste, but that will come soon.

### Day 2: March 22, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Didnt reach out to two ppl on twitter but tweets were liked. 
                      Two hours on FCC.
                      

**Thoughts** Lets focus on hope and not fear.

FCC

**Idea** : I am awake button for the mobile alarm, no need to turn of the alarm on an off again to prevent if from going off. This can be an interesting project.

### Day 3: March 23, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Reached out to two ppl on twitter  @EvanEichelberg2  @cvillafraz 
                      The challenge seems to only do projects. Lets do those projects then. 
                      I am not sure if spending time on FCC even counts.
                      

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 9: March 29, 2019 - Friday

**Today's Progress**:  CSS pixels and other concepts of Responsive design, FCC with basic javascript( redundant but good for habit creation)

**Thoughts:**  No excuses to not spending time on learning, even if this in not pure coding, learning new concepts and keeping the flow is very important. A fixed time will also help.
