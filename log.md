# 100 Days of Code: IvesNoIdea's Log

## Day 1 of 100: 3rd January 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on personal web page

**Thoughts:** The coding is OK, it's Git that's...well...a git! I can't figure out how to make it apply my CSS to my HTML. Also, when I create a new branch locally, and make some commits on it, then try to push it to the remote, I get a fatal error. I need to do more research to figure these problems out.

**Link to Work:** Nothing worth showing yet


## Day 2 of 100: 4th January 2017

**Today's Progress** I don't want to say this too loudly and jinx myself, but...today has gone pretty well. Maybe it's because I forced myself to focus on one small area - laying out the bare bones of my website - rather than thinking about all surrounding fancy stuff. Tomorrow's aim is to figure out how to apply CSS to my GitHub page. But for today, I'm heading back over to FreeCodeCamp to carry on with my JavaScript tutorials.

## Day 3 of 100: 5th January 2017

**Today's Progress:** Still having trouble applying my CSS. It seems a bit hit-and-miss. Some bits get applied and others don't. I'm not going to worry about it too much just yet. If it doesn't resolve in a couple of days I will head on to the forum and ask someone to check it over for me. There must be a simple explanation, and I just can't see the wood for the trees.

## Day 4 of 100: 6th January 2017

**Today's Progress:** More work on stylesheet today. Added background image to page header (need to tweak image size / padding so it looks right) and background colours to the rest of the page. Not quite sure why my topnav isn't going right across the page, just the first column. Maybe it will stretch once I put stuff in the other columns...but that's a job for tomorrow.

## Day 5 of 100: 7th January 2017

**Today's Progress:** Lots of messing about with margins, padding, div sizes and positions today. Finally getting close to the layout I'm looking for. Tomorrow's plan is to set up the navbar buttons to jump to each section of the page.

**Link to Work:** Same as above


## Day 6 of 100: 8th January 2017

**Today's Progress** Sorted out nabar buttons and began adding content to the 'About Me' section of my page. Having a bit of trouble getting my content to go *inside* its parent div...not sure what that's all about. Need to do some research to try and figure it out.

**Link to Work** Same as above

## Day 7 of 100: 9th January 2017

**Today's Progress:** A bit of a cop-out today. I'm generally using my coding time to consolidate what I've learned in FreeCodeCamp tutorials. But there comes a point where I need to learn some new stuff in order to consolidate it! So today (and probably the next couple of days), I'm working through the FCC tutorials on JavaScript. Then I will figure out how to combine that with my HTML and CSS in a web app. 

**Thoughts** It occurs to me that I haven't practiced using form fields yet, so maybe I can build some form fields into my web page, then put some JS behind them to return a result based on the input...hmm, I need to give this some thought.

## Day 8 of 100: 10th January 2017

**Today's Progress:** Just a bit of messing about, really. I've been reading up on how to incorporate JavaScript into an HTML webpage, so I've set up a simple HTML document that I can muck about with and try different stuff out.

**Thoughts:** I really need to figure out how to get user input from a form field on my HTML document, into a JS function, and then display the output from the function. Even if it's just a case of inputting a number and getting JS to double it and return the result! Setting up a form field to accept a number is easy enough. And getting JS to take a variable, double it and return the result is easy enough. But how do I tie them together?!

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
