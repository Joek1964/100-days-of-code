# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 28th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Cleaned up an old html email, and started a responsive version using Cerberus. [Committed to Github](https://github.com/christinavoudouris/responsive-emails).

**Thoughts:** Feeling less overwhelmed by the project and seeing how helpful the notes in the template are.

### Day 2: May 29th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on responsive HTML email. [Committed to Github](https://github.com/christinavoudouris/responsive-emails).

**Thoughts:** Many thoughts! The original email is from 2012; the navigation bar needs to either stack or maybe not be displayed on small devices. More media queries need to be considered. Mixed feelings on 3 columns for 3 rows worth of products; perhaps 2 columns would work, but the original images are small. Forcing the initial-scale also made the email mobile friendly, though the template notes said it shouldn't be forced. Hmmm...
