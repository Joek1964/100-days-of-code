# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 6, 2023
##### Back to Basics

**Today's Progress**: Read first two days of Turing lessons MOD 1 to refresh my memory. Jotted down brand new organized notes into Notion. Completed all challenges and replits given in each lesson.

**Thoughts:** I was reccomended by an istructor to go back to the basics since I took a year off. It's a good starting place for me because of it. I wanted to make sure I still knew things and it felt good that I am able to still solve code related problems. It's nice to have a community behind you rooting for yor success.
