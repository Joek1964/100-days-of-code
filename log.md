### Day 0: March 16, 2018 :heavy_check_mark:

**Today's Progress**: Practice React and redux in a simple exercise, for this I read documentation official and watched tutorials in Youtube for my doubts.

**Thoughts:** I feel so good, because I'm understand better components and props from React. The Practice make a master.  :clap:
