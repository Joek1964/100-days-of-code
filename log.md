# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 30, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I started working through the FreeCodeCamp front end developer curriculum. 

**Keywords of the day**: styles, classes, anchors, input, lists, required input, radio buttons, checking buttons by default

**Thoughts** I knew many of these early HTML/CSS concepts, though not committed to memory.

### Day 0: April 29, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I've created all of the neccesary accounts as well as stood up my Ubuntu dev environment.

**Thoughts** Feels awesome to get organized and start down this path. It's going to take some effort to keep from being distracted between learning at work and here.
