# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 14, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Setting up this repo and these Markdown log files for my run at 100 Days of Code.  Also created [New Twitter Account](https://twitter.com/absenth762) so I can tweet with the hashtag as required.

**Thoughts:** I will be doing this challenge with at least one other co-worker, which will make it easy to keep eachother accounable and to potentially help if either of us get stuck on projects.  I would like to livestream a bunch of my 1 hour sessions, but don't want to commit to livestreaming all of them.

### Day 1: September 18, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I wrote a bandname generator that either asks for the City you grew up in, and a favorite Pet's name.  Or it uses a random word API to build a band name from two random words provided by the API

**Thoughts:**: I'm following along with Angela Yu's 100-days-of-code course from the London App Brewery to keep pace with one of my co-workers

### Day 2: September 19, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I wrote a tip calulator.  It takes the total bill, number of payers, and a tip percentage and calculates how much each person should pay.

### Day 4 September 21, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I wrote this rock paper scissors game while on a flight to AUS to CLT.  I didn't add the ascii art but I did play with dictionaries for the various game states rather than a large if/elif/else array.
