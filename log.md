# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2018, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started the HTML5 and CSS challenges for the Front End Development Certification

**Thoughts**: Thus far I'm not feeling too tested with these challenges. I'm sure that will change as I progress.

### Day 2: January 2, 2018, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the remaining HTML5 and CSS challenges and got through about 1/3 of Repsonsive Design With Bootstrap section.

**Thoughts**: Today I felt a slight tug not to do the challenges because I'm a little tired and Winter break with the wife and kids is starting to come to a close. In addition to that I ended up checking my work e-mail before starting so I began my hour somewhat distracted; not a good idea. Maybe tomorrow I'll try to give myself a few minutes to sort of reset my focus before starting.

### Day 3: January 3, 2018, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the remaining Responsive Design with Bootstrap challenges and got through about half of jQuery section.

**Thoughts**: Once again felt a slight resistance to starting the challenges, but I pushed through it. I didn't make the same mistake as yesterday by reading work e-mail. Nevertheless I was still somewhat distracted. The jQuery section is proving to be slightly more difficult than previous challenges mostly because I'm not that familiar with JavaScript syntax. On the upside, I do feel like I'm actually learning with these challenges so that's exciting.
