# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Thursday, May 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've continued to work through "The Complete Web Developer in 2019: Zero to Mastery" on Udemy. Today I learned about Javascript conditionals, including "ternary operator" and "switch". I also went through the Basic HTML section of FreeCodeCamp as a refresher.

**Thoughts**: I've found learning Javascript to be difficult compared to HTML and CSS. It's hard to stay motivated when I don't understand the concepts or have a vision for what they should be used for just yet. I have continued to use google and other resources to help me understand concepts further. I am excited to begin this #100DaysOfCode to hold myself accountable and track my progress.
