# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 21JUL18
Having been a coder for quite some time, this seemed like a good idea to bump it up.
Let's see how well it works. 

 * Github Fork, first commit, beginning the Learnfree code camp material. All review. expect rapid advancement. 
 * Need to rememeber how to Github pretty darn soon it would seem. Haven't been on here for too long.
 
 ### Day 0.5: 22JUL18 [pre-sleep]
 Haven't slept yet. Pretty damned jazzed. Made it through 148 / 1408 coding challenges today.
 Mostly basic review. A few golden nuggets though.
 Sincerely hoping to get some real applications finished during this 100 day challenge thing.
