# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 4, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: 
I'm building an RGB color game. There will be six squares that will have random colors. Based on the RGB color code shown at the top of the page, the player will be able to guess which is the correct color. The player will be informed whether or not they chose the right color and will have the option to try again. For now, the colors are hard coded. Eventually, a random color will be given and the player will be able to chose which is the correct color of the six colors shown. 

- [x] In HTML, there are six divs with different background colors for each square.
- [x] In CSS, each div is styled with the following properties:
  - background color
  - padding-bottom
  - float
  - margin
  - width
- [x] In JS:
  - An array of six hard coded colors.
  - A hard coded default RGB color value (for now) in the h1 tag.
  - Click event listeners that alerts the player of the color that was clicked on.
 
**Thoughts:** 
I'm glad I was able to start building a color game. However, working in Cloud9 is challenging. I spent quite a bit of time looking for errors when it turns out c9 was the issue.  I may have to go back to using Caret as the text editor on my Chromebook.
