# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day -3: Friday, January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Forked and updated the repo, read the articles, updated my Twitter <-- in preparation to start this challenge on Monday.

**Thoughts:** After reading the rules, I'm approaching this with a fair amount of trepidation - a little worried.  But that is why it's called a challenge, no?  One hour of Netflix every night is not a challenge.  One hour of code not related to work will definitely be interesting.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
