# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 2nd, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
Completed CodeWars Katas:
1. Even or Odd
2. Surface Area and Volume of a Box
3. Remove String Spaces
4. Convert boolean values to strings 'Yes' or 'No'.


**Thoughts:** 
It was not easy to start as I couldn't decide what I should do first - start a bigger project or complete some smaller ones. Finally I decided to complete some CodeWars Katas as a warm up.
