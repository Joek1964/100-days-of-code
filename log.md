# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 27, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Basic HTML and HTML5 course on Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts:** This was monotonus and boring, I realize now I can just finish the 5 final projects to get the certification and move on to the JavaScript curriculum.

### Day 2: June 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Set-up and started development on my new portfolio website. I need a foundation to display my projects and this will be a good start. I'm not aiming for anything fancy, just clean, simple, and to the point.

**Thoughts**: This was really fun when not building using restraints. No need to ask for permission on a color or particular style. I can just build and adapt. I should code for personal interest far more often, it feels good.

### Day 3: June 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created a project called MATH IS FUN! The goal of the project is to do one math problem a day by solving it with a javascript function. The goal being to improve both my math skills and functional programming. 

**Thoughts**: This should be a good daily warm up excercise that I can do long-term. It's short yet challenging and oddly satisfying when I get it right. Also this is a great opportunity to write unit tests for my math problems.

### Day 4: June 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on portfolio website building the second section of the home page. In process of creating a tab for website showcases and programming projects to link in my github account. 

**Thoughts**: I need to gather showcase work and determine how I'll showcase code projects. Possibly titles, but It would be cool to have some sort of graphical element.
