# 100 Days Of Code - Log
## rule 10:90

### Day 0: January 9, 2017
**Today's Progress:** finished 4 chapters on Eloquent Javascript adding several interesting codes on exercises, digested 2 workshops of Founder & Coders on week2.

**Thoughts:** Exercises on Eloquent Javascript were not easy at all. I enjoy reading this book as it really helps me recap concepts and terminologies I have been confused with. Pure function workshop was fun. Last night, I was coding in dream.

**Improvements:** Getting started early in the morning is the key. As I only give myself 10 days to grind the basic, I must speed up on reading textbook and workshops.

### Day 1: January 10, 2017
**Today's Progress:** Today, first I finished traffic light workshop. Then I worked on 3 workshops on API. I learned XMLHttpRequest is Javascript's way to make http to use http methods to communicate with a server. I installed postman. I could not finish third workshop.

**Thoughts:** I hardly remembered the materials so it is take a quite of efforts to catch up. I should focus more on learning in-depth rather than speed.

**Improvements:** Writing down codes on paper helps a lot. Also, I need to understand callbacks better

### Day 2: January 11, 2017
**Today's Progress:** First, I finished a workshop on getting data using Github api. I like chapter 5. higher-order functions on Eloquent JS and examples on filter,map,reduce and bind were interesting. Also I've made a plan for next week.

**Thoughts:** Writing many helper functions and passing functions as values/arguments is relatively new but very neat.

**Improvements:** I would like to share a quote I saw yesterday.Most people quit because they look how far they have to go, not how far they have come.

### Day 3: January 12, 2017
**Today's Progress:** I slightly grasped the concept of making instance of object and setting it's own property. (I plan to do another tutorial on object then go back to this chapter later and rather move on for now). After hitting the wall too much with my head, I worked on node girl workshop. There I finally understood that node is an environment which offers a large set of modules which enable Javascript to be written to communicate with a server.

**Thoughts:** It was a day of frustration but I came out better. I must admit that I am in a very good circumstance in no position to complain to learn new skills for a career shift. I will integrate the attitude of 'challenge fucking accepted'

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
