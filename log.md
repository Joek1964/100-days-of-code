**Today's Progress**: <!--Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.-->

**Thoughts:**  
  Got to know the rules of the challenge and the primary goal of this challenge. Every little bit of progress needs aplomb. Even a small step is progress. Focus on the positve.

### Day 1: March 21,2019 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Reached out to two ppl on twitter  [@EvanEichelberg2](https://twitter.com/@EvanEichelberg2)

                      The best way to laerning is via solving projects of your own or collaborative projects.
                      FCC exercises are also counted as time spent coding. 
                      I also used exercism and it took me loads of time to set it up, a tedious start.
                      

**Thoughts** Not focusing on one thing at a time cost time and effort, its harder to focus on one thing when there are so many opportunities out there but the thing is use one resource and learn well from it. Not starting a project gave a miserable taste, but that will come soon.

### Day 9: March 29, 2019 - Friday

**Today's Progress**:  CSS pixels and other concepts of Responsive design, FCC with basic javascript( redundant but good for habit creation)

**Thoughts:**  No excuses to not spending time on learning, even if this in not pure coding, learning new concepts and keeping the flow is very important. A fixed time will also help.
