# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Days 1- 9, before it occurred to me to put things on GitHub

**Progress**: Dataquest: 58% through Intro to Python, 18% through Intermediate Python and Pandas 
(Skipping anything that isn't included in the free package.)

**Thoughts:** First week was fun and exciting and now it's a bit of a struggle. I think it's an [extinction burst](https://youarenotsosmart.com/2010/07/07/extinction-burst/)

**Link to work:** not yet.

### Day 10: April 25, 2018
##### (five hashmarks looks like this - I don't really do Markup)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: Last night was Crafting for Coders. It was scary to be in a room with all of these people who knew a whole culture that I don't know. I had to remind myself that things will feel different in a month or two. I'm glad these events will be monthly. It'll be a great way to mark my progress!

**Link(s) to work**: Maybe tomorrow. ;-)


### Three Hashmarks

**Between two asterisks**: Text.

**Same as previous** There's a space between these.
