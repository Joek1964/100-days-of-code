# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 03, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: React, worked on React's Functional Components in branches footer and main.

**Thoughts:** I worked on React's Functional Components: footer and main for both desktop and mobile views. I found it difficult to pinpoint reusable components for these two views, especially when one or another component was shown in the desktop view but not in the mobile view, and vice versa. It took me a while to identify which ones to replicate for both cases.
