### Day 0: January 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Got development environment setup on Laptop since I had reformatted my hard drive.

**Thoughts:** Think I'm going to start with doing some of the FreeCodeCamp tutorials.  Web development has always been a passion of mine and I haven't every really taken time to learn it beyond basic HTML and CSS.
