# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 27, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Basic HTML and HTML5 course on Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts:** This was monotonus and boring, I realize now I can just finish the 5 final projects to get the certification and move on to the JavaScript curriculum.

### Day 2: June 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Set-up and started development on my new portfolio website. I need a foundation to display my projects and this will be a good start. I'm not aiming for anything fancy, just clean, simple, and to the point.

**Thoughts**: This was really fun when not building using restraints. No need to ask for permission on a color or particular style. I can just build and adapt. I should code for personal interest far more often, it feels good.

### Day 3: June 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created a project called MATH IS FUN! The goal of the project is to do one math problem a day by solving it with a javascript function. The goal being to improve both my math skills and functional programming. 

**Thoughts**: This should be a good daily warm up excercise that I can do long-term. It's short yet challenging and oddly satisfying when I get it right. Also this is a great opportunity to write unit tests for my math problems.

### Day 4: June 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on portfolio website building the second section of the home page. In process of creating a tab for website showcases and programming projects to link in my github account. 

**Thoughts**: I need to gather showcase work and determine how I'll showcase code projects. Possibly titles, but It would be cool to have some sort of graphical element.

### Day 5: July 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Took yesterday's holiday off for Canada Day. Today I was able to create work preview cards with a slide down hover effect for project details.

**Thoughts**: I'm finding a lot of inspiration from this person's portfolio site: [See their portfolio](https://caferati.me/) I'm liking my progress on this project. I think I should build most of my own functionality using js/php rather than using plugins for everything. It will grow my skills more and it will keep my site lighter weight.

### Day 6: July 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I fixed the "Design" and "Development" nav tabs so they were appropriately sized. I added centered and styled tags to info in the hover drop down. I also added a functional newsletter sign-up form to my website and linked it to my mailchimp account.

**Thoughts**: I got distracted by vacation and the holidays. It's easy to just not do it but I want to see this challenge through and am beginning as if I'd never taken a day off. While it is challenging to find the time everyday to work on my own stuff it feels so worth it at the end. Also, it feels great to be able to do creative work without worrying about someone else's opinion. It feels good to work on something for myself rather than just pumping out business websites like a machine.
