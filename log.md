# 100 Days Of Code - Log
# My Personal Commitment: I'm going to master Javascript and culminate with the freecodecamp certification on JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures. 


### Day 0: May 09, 2022 

**Today's Progress** 
Forked the 100-days-of-code repo, made a commitment on Twitter, followed a few ppl on Twitter, interacted with developers, joined the discussion on Gitter, Setup environment on Google Chrome and installed the open source application Brackets as my code editor for this challenge. 

**Thoughts:** 
I have been using Javascript for as long as I remember and I'd say I understand it to an extent. However, Javascript has evolved a great deal over the years from being a fully client side interpreted language to the amazing language it is today. I decided to use this challenge to master the language and create a solid foundation to learn some amazing frameworks such as Vue and React. 

I'm excited to use this challenge also as a way to create a solid coding habit. I love coding but I have not yet been able to fully master a regular coding habit. I know first hand how important it is to develop solid habits to step up my game in anything I want to do. I have done this before to develop a gym habit, running habit and weight loss habit. I have been able to achieve remarkable progress healthwise. I want to expand my habit development to other areas that I want to work on such as improving my coding skills.
