# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 18, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Built structure (HTML) for a form page.

**Thoughts:** I felt this was quite easy. The only challenging part was what HTML attributes to use while creating the form page. I realized the CSS won't be this easy though.

**Coding time:** Around 1 hour.

### Day 1: August 19, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Started working on form styling using CSS.

**Thoughts:** It was quite intimidating at first, because I didn't know which attributes to use. There are so many of them. But I decided to not fall into analysis paralysis and started to use the most common attributes and get my hands dirty. Overall it was quite a relief knowing I had understood some CSS topics such as box model, etc. I hope to learn more by doing and getting my hands dirty, without being afraid that I would fail.

**Coding time:** Around 30 minutes.
