# 100 Days Of Code - Log



### Day 1:  Oct 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Building One Page More

**Thoughts/Notes/Braindump space:**   

**Pre-Build Space -->** The Reading List (RL) can exist without the Book (B) objects.  RL is basically a shelf to display things, anything really, books, people, rotary phones, etc.  The shelf can exist without the book in this context.  The B can not exist without the shelf (they would be floating like fruit in a jello ring.  We need to bring jello rings back.)

Okay, so now that I better understand this relationship, I see how I need to incorporate the ORM and collections.  

**Post-Build Space -->**  So, don't get mad.  I added Users instead.  This made a lot of sense with the section of the book I was reading.  While I was trying to figure out how to build the Book/RL relationship, the set up in the book made the most sense here.  Parent can add child AND book, but can now assign book to specific child (I hope)

(having a hard time testing this right now since I didn't finish my inital task and that is full of errors preventing me from running it, BUT in spirit I think it is a good start)

### Day 0: Oct 1, 2020


**Today's Progress**: I did code, but I wanted to set my intention and create a space for me to work through my blocks.  This Project is my final project for LaunchCode's LiftOff.  It is the (first) and biggest thing I have ever build on my own.  I am trying to make space for it in my day to day life, and hope that creating a place to plan, ponder, and grow from will be more helpful than just a list of Ta-Da's!  For me.  

I added a place to drop things.  I added space to list my goal for the day and a place to list where I stopped.  But these spaces are also places that can hold more than just facts and figures, but the story behind it all, the place when connections are made.  So, if you want to read along, you are welcome to.  I will try to keep these updates short and to the point.  

I should make a parking lot...  but not here.  

**Thoughts/Notes/Braindump space:** 

**Pre-Build Space -->**  Rethink my process.  How do I best learn?  Stories, writing about it, making connections.

**Post-Build Space: -->**  So, here is my redesigned log.  My rekindled passion to make this project happen.
