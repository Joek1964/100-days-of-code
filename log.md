### Day 2: October 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Applied more styles to Michelle Obama tribute page, also
fixed some typos. I copied the code into a Codepen and linked to it from my
repo's readme.

**Thoughts**: This is really fun! This first coding challenge is pretty simple
though. Actually, I considered adding more flourishes to the site but thought
it just didn't fit the challenge brief.

### Day 3: October 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the Survey Form challenge.

**Thoughts**: It's been awhile since I last created an HTML form. It's like
riding a bike - I just have to glance at the documentation for a refresher on
things, but it's all coming back.

Here's where I left off today:

### Day 4: October 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished the user stories in FCC's
[Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Survey Form](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-survey-form)

**Thoughts** Today was slower than previous days. I got stuck on
trying to style the checkboxes in my form. I found some advice on the w3schools
site, as well as on Stack Overflow, but wasn't able to successfully style the
checkboxes as I had wanted to.

I also asked in FCC Discord and the person who
responded reaffirmed that these are notoriously difficult to manage with CSS.

So after awhile I moved on without applying the styles I had wanted.

### Day 5: October 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Went through FreeCodeCamp lessons on CSS Flexbox and CSS
grid. I experimented with applying the material to my site but didn't merge
any code.

**Thoughts**: I've used this stuff before but it's been awhile, so it's good
to review. I think that layout is the toughest part about CSS, in my experience.


### Day 6: November 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Adjusted survey form layout using CSS grid but it looks
pretty buggy and needs more work.

**Thoughts**: On the one hand, I'm a little frustrated that CSS layouts are so
hard to get right, but glad that I'm focusing my attention here so I can level
up.

### Day 7: November 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made lots of progress on adjusting layout using a combo
of CSS grid and flexbox! I'm pretty much done with this challenge. I just need
to make some adjustments to my HTML markup before I can submit it.

**Thoughts**: This was fun! I'm glad I was able to overcome the layout challenges
I encountered after some more effort!

Here's the finished layout on a large screen:

### Day 8:

**Today's Progress**: I made a few last changes to my survey form to be able
to pass the automated tests by FCC. The only noticeable user-facing change
is that the last input field is now a `<textarea>` instead of `<input>`.

I also started working on the next FCC Code challenge to create a [product
landing page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-product-landing-page).

**Thoughts**: Since this challenge includes using a few different images as
well as a video, there's some risk of getting sidetracked. For example, I
spent maybe 10 minutes creating a logo for a fictional business.

I'm also not feeling 100% today, so I feel a little slow getting things going.

### Day 9:

**Today's Progress**: Finished adding minimum required html elements to landing
page and also started adding CSS.

**Thoughts**: CSS can be so finicky and frustrating sometimes! I'm also trying
to think of ways I can work more quickly. However, I also see value in taking my
time with these basic front-end projects so I can use them as building blocks
for future projects.

### Day 10:

**Today's Progress**: Was able to fix some spacing issues in the site for
mobile, and made lots of progress on the nav bar for mobile.

**Thoughts**: Although I felt frustrated yesterday, I got a rush from making
so much progress today!

### Day 11:

**Today's Progress**: I more or less finalized the header nav on mobile, then
moved on to format the intro section and am starting to work on the "Our Classes"
section.

**Thoughts**: Same as in previous days, I fluctuate between being frustrated
with CSS layouts and then feeling very rewarded once I get it working the
way I want, and it looks great!

**Link(s) to work**: Today's [PR](https://github.com/newwebash/fcc-product-landing-page/pull/4)


### Day 12:

**Today's Progress**: Finished the basic layout for small mobile screens. There's
a bit more styling to do to smooth out the rough edges, but it's pretty good
as of now!

**Thoughts**: It's so exciting to see things coming together!
