# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 5 December, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a Gatsby project for my portfolio using the hello world starter theme.

**Thoughts:** Gatsby is still very new to me. I am figuring out the project file stucture and testing out different themes. Started the tutorial by CodeAddict "Gatsby - Strapi portfolio"  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asB-dUwpH4Y. Learning to use React custom hooks for the first time.

### Day 2: 6 December, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continue working on my internship task the Talent Profile page. Completed components: Linked Accounts, User Details, Address. Almost finished working on the Nationality component but unable to continue due to issues with microservices not responding.

**Thoughts:** The Microservices within the project keeps closing unexpectedly and it is creating problems with debugging/testing. I have tried clean/rebuild in visual studio and close and restarting the npm server. 

### Day 3: 7 December, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Internship task. Completed Nationality component which allows talents to set their nationality. Starting working on the Languages component

**Thoughts:** Languages component requires tables, input text form, input option form, semantic buttons, semantic icons. Looking into semantic grids to format the components nicely

### Day 4: 8 December, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made some good progress on the Languages component. I have the UI components working but cannot figure out why it is either not saving or fetching from the Database

**Thoughts:** It is proving to be more difficult than i originally thought. I may have to start this component from scratch.

### Day 5: 9 December, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continue working on the languages component

**Thoughts:** Issues with saving languages to the Db. The function addLanguage() has null ID values after first language has been saved

### Day 5: 10 December, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Fixed the backend code for languages component 

### Day 6: 11 December, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the languages component. There is a bug when saving a new language to the database for the first time, the ID's are saved as NULLs. After the component is refreshed, the language objects functions as normal. TODO: Look into solution

**Thoughts:** Working on the the next task - Skills component

### Day 7: 13 December, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Skills component on hold for now while i am thinking of good code design. Working on Visa status component

**Thoughts:** Completed Visa stats component. The CSS styling took me a while to figure out. Initially i used inline css style on the header's to space out the dropdown box. Looked into semantic ui Grids to evenly space-out the columns. Used CSS class "ui right floated teal button" to move the button to the right.
