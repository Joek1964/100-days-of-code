**Today's Progress**: [posted on Twitter] 4 hours on Day 1, whoop! Not sure how to use this log, though... https://github.com/Heathyr/100-days-of-code ‚Ä¶. I forked it - now what, haha??? #CodeNewbie #100DaysofCode

**Thoughts:** Struggling with CSS, don't fully understand positioning

Day 3: January 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: [posted on Twitter] Day 3, woo-hoo! My hour today consisted mainly of trying to pound the finer points of the box model into my brain. Sad but true, haha. Whatever - I'm claiming the win for putting in my time! #CodeNewbie #100DaysOfCode

Day 11: January 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: [posted on Twitter] Day 11 - Loving @freeCodeCamp's Applied Visual Design track! Finally starting to understand how positioning works instead of flying blind and crossing my fingers, haha üòç #CodeNewbie #100DaysOfCode

Finished @freeCodeCamp's Applied Visual Design track, whoop-whoop! Really starting to love CSS & excited to learn more animation üòÉ #CodeNewbie #100DaysOfCode

Day 12: January 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: [posted on Twitter] Day 12 - Completed Applied Accessibility portion of #freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification ü•≥ #CodeNewbie #100DaysOfCode

**Thoughts** Really enjoyed learning more about internet accessibility. It got me thinking about my uncle who is blind. I would love to help the world be more accessible for people like him. I've thought a lot about how our super-technical, internet-driven world leaves so many people behind, but in the past my thoughts have focused on older generations and those in poverty who can't afford computers and other tech. This lesson has reminded me how much differently-abled people miss out on as well.

Day 15: January 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: [posted on Twitter] Day 15 - Been working hard on my @freeCodeCamp tribute page. Trying to add a CSS collage using this guide: https://css-tricks.com/seamless-responsive-photo-grid/ ‚Ä¶, but can't get bottoms to even up. Any ideas? #CodeNewbie #100DaysofCode #WomenWhoCode

Day 16: January 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: [posted on Twitter] Day 16 - Just finished my first @freeCodeCamp project: https://heathyr.github.io/tribute/ . Bit off a little more than I could chew, but am enjoying the results, for the most part üòÄüåàüéá ü•≥ #CodeNewbie #100DaysOfCode #WomenWhoCode

**Thoughts** Love my tribute page - it's so colorful and happy! I had to let go of the CSS collage because I couldn't get the bottoms to line up, but I'm proud of myself for stretching well beyond my comfort zone. As a workaround, I designed the collage in another program and used the jpg for my site.

Now that I'm designing things that bring me joy, I'm enjoying this whole coding thing a lot more. Also, doing this tribute to a Maori trans activist has shown me that coding can not only be fun, but can contribute to the world in a positive way. I'm looking forward to helping out some non-profits with some web dev when I can :)

Day 17: January 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finally took the time to figure out how this GitHub log works - yay! Filled in all the progress from previous days, as recorded on Twitter. As for coding, I played a bit more with my tribute page but ultimately reverted back to the original because my experiments in simplifying the responsive CSS were unsuccessful. I tweaked the Rogue Pickings site into a perfect starter site for an upcoming vegan food truck business in Daytona Beach, replacing the green beans image with a beautiful full-color fruits & veggies pic I found on Adobe Stock. Loving the new, colorful look :)

**Thoughts** I feel so good about the vegan food truck site! It's beautiful and will give this struggling small business owner a leg up :)

And one last thought: I just realized I forgot to create a branch on my forked repo before I started all these updates - doh! Sooo... gonna have to remember that next time.
