**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

## Day 0: 02 January, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the resume project and added the resume data in JSON format.

**Thoughts**: Structuring the resume data in JSON format has thought me about the advantages of managing data in object literal notation in Javascript.

## Day 1: 03 January, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked further on the resume project and updated the contacts section.

**Thoughts**: The append and prepend methods in JQuery has been tricky in the resume project. I finished the resume project today.
