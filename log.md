// # 100 Days Of Code - Log

// ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
// ##### (delete me or comment me out)

// **Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

// **Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 0: january 10, 2017

**Todays progress** ive gone through lots of git documentation
                    ive learnt how to revert changes, create repo and even sync project between
                    local machine and my online repo

**Thoughts** ive only used git for my local project and ive not really gotten the hang of it quite yet
             but then ive read a few things today that i plan on practicing. ive only been able to used
             the dektop version of github to sync my files remotely but i plan on learning the command line 
             parameters

**links to work** none yet



### Day 1: january 11, 2017

**Todays progress** creating and initialising the repository id use for my tribute webpage
                    *since* i want to use material design not bootstrap for the page, im working
                    on getting materials on the use of material design by google.

**Thoughts**        since im going out of my comfort zone for this tribute page,id like to learn 
                    about mdl too

###Day 2: january 12, 2017###

**Todays Progress** I ended up starting the project assignment i dropped for my coursera full stack web
                    development course and it was basically about javascript.
                    i wasnt really able to do much as i had to do a lot of research work and also reading.
                    i was able to get throgh to the first and second stage of the work which is quite a big 
                    progress for me

**Thoughts** well i think i made good on my desire to code today as i spend more hours on github and in my ide 
             than on watching tutorial videos.

**link to work** id be available in a couple of Days
