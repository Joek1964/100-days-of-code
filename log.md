# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Friday, October 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Set up github repo, tweeted that I'm starting the challenge
Created a Day1 folder in my repo, and am planning on making a simple counter app
I will be using Express, Bulma, and Fontawesome to start.

**Thoughts** 
I was thinking today about me being older than all of my classmates in the bootcamp, and so was thinking of projects to do with a theme of "old dog, new tricks".
