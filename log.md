# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 2, 2017.

**Today's Progress**: Forked the 100 days of code repository, joined Free Code Camp, read everything in detail for the 100 days of code.

**Thoughts:** I am a very new dev, and this required quite of bit of learning, but I am excited for the challenge.
