## The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge - [@jacobwarduk](https://github.com/jacobwarduk)

I'd like to think that I'll be completing more than one round of 100 days of code, so I've preemptively pre-fixed my log with "Round 1". 

### Round 1 - Started on July 17, Monday, 2017.

There are a number of projects and goals I've had in my head or on the back-burner for some time. These are what I am hoping to work on.

##### Projects
 - Personal website
 - Pok√©mon Trading Card App
 
 ##### Goals
 - Learn Angular 2/4
 - Learn ReactJS and its eco-system
