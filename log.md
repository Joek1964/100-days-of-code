# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 7: January 4, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Not much to speak of. Read some of JavaScript for Web Developers, then did my hour on Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts:** A little frustrated, a lot determined to learn more and understand. I won't stay away from the project too long. I know there is a lesson in this process.

### Day 6: January 3, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Not much to speak of. Still working in the console to 'see' what's going on. Coercion has caught me up. My input from my prompt( ) is a string and not a number.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm missing something. I need to read up more on coercion, so this makes sense and I can gain a working knowledge of why this is happening.

### Day 5: January 2, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Worked with Firefox Scratchpad to bang out a few scenarios. 

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling more comfortable about what the app is doing and I think I'm almost there.

### Day 4: January 1, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Seperated Check split from tip calc. Added js button to other page. I didn't upload to site, yet.

**Thoughts:** Adding the splitCheck to the tip calc broke the calc. I decided to move it to it's own page. I need to figure this out.

**Task List**
[] Add a split check option
[] Add bootstrap or make responsive on mobile

### Day 3: December 31, 2016 

**Today's Progress**: Configured a clear form button. Changed fonts and colors.

**Thoughts:** If you set the inputs to all have the same name, once you select a second radio button, the previous one will be deselected.

- [Tip Calculator App] (http://tipcalc.angelaandrews.netne.net/)

### Day 1: December 29, 2016 

**Today's Progress**: Changed the presentation and added radio buttons to select tip.

**Thoughts:** I didn't know where to start, so for fear of not starting at all, I forked a CodePen Repo and started pulling apart a tip calculator.
