# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Built a project called "Two Thirds of Average" which I got from [ryanstutorials.net](https://ryanstutorials.net/programming-challenges) with C++. This is my first project with C++.

**Thoughts:** I am finding C++ quite interesting and I think I would love to learn more of it. I used an old editor (DevCpp) and an old version though and that slowed me down. I plan to upgrade soon so I can enjoy learning the language better.

### Day 2: October 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today, inspired by the console Star Wars animation at *towel.blinkenlights.nl*, I decided to build a C++ animation called BlinkingLights. It is a simple animation that involves characters on the screen blinking and changing colour.

**Thoughts:** I found this very interesting and not as difficult as I expected.

### Day 3: October 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today, I created an application to extract text from images using Tesseract's C++ OCR library and OpenCV.

**Thoughts:** This project is something I've wanted to do for a long time. I'm glad I finally got to it. It was a bit easy and I did not really learn any new thing in C++, just how to use the Tesseract and OpenCV libraries. Also, having to write about it forced me to make sure I understood the code.

### Day 4: October 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today, I installed ReactJS, added a library for text to speech and wrote some code to call the library.

**Thoughts:** I got a bit frustrated due to technical issues with my system, but I will continue tomorrow.

### Day 5: October 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today, I installed NodeJS, and created the back end for the image to speech project. I learnt how to create a basic web app with Express.js, how to call commands from Node.js, how to receive an uploaded file and save it to the file system.

**Thoughts:** Today's task was quite interesting as I learnt many new things.

### Day 6: October 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today, I installed React.js and wrote the front end for the image to speech project. I learnt how to make requests in React using axios, how to call the SpeechSynthesis API to read out text and how to write a React application in general.

**Thoughts:** Today's task was very interesting. I learnt many new things.

### Day 7: October 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today, I learnt how to add simple auto-completion to a C++ application.

**Thoughts:** Although I learnt some new things like how to manipulate strings (which was my goal), I still wish to improve this auto-completion tool as it's not perfect yet.
