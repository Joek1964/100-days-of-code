**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: Finalized functionality on the calculator project. Also completed the UI. I am satisfied.

**Thoughts:** Working on the logic was quite difficult and I had to do extensive research. Although not the cleanest code out there, I made it work. I will refactor this in future once I am more familiar with better coding practices.



### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
