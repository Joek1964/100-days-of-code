# 100 Days Of Code (Python focused) - Log

<!---
### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: October 29, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've started this challange, learned the basics of using GitHub and have set up my cloud storage for easy codebase syncinc between workstations. Ive prepared a bunch of materials for me to start learning from and about. Most likely will start with the good old "AUTOMATE THE BORING STUFF WITH PYTHON - PRACTICAL PROGRAMMING FOR TOTAL BEGINNERS" by Al Sweigart. The book starts from the very basics, I'm now up to page 77, ended up playing around with matplotlib data vizualization library after completing the first little code challange for a Collatz Sequence generator.

**Thoughts** Today marks the start of my Python 100 day coding challange, hopefully it goes well and im able to strenghten my coding skills. Most likely wont upload the python sketches daily, since they are very primitive and dont govern much recognition. Will batch upload them to Git after I finish the book.
