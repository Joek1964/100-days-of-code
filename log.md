#100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Uploaded landing page/ portfolio to github. Made edits to
project cards, fixed typos, etc.

**Thoughts**: I feel very insecure about putting myself out here, but I also
feel that I'm coding in a vacuum. I also feel that I'm not ready, since I don't
list every project I've completed for freecodecamp (fCC) on my landing page.
But-- better to publish and add features as I go rather than to never publish at
all.

**Update**: Tried to push my own master branch to the actual master branch.
Totally embaressed. Well, it's all roses from here, haha.

### Day 1: June 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Downloaded code for my weather app from codepen.io. Added
code so that it functions as a stand-alone webpage. Also, fixed the colors on
my wiki search app.

**Thoughts**: Looks like github doesn't count contributions you make when you
check in code from your master branch. I uploaded the new weather app, but it
didn't show progress. So I made some color changes on the wiki app, and pushed
that. Slowly learning git and making it secondhand knowledge.

Already, I'm doubting myself. I came home, fed the cat, sat down, and started
the pomodoro timer. That timer is what keeps me going, as long as I can start.

   -**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

   -**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
