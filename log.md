### Day 5: June 25th, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Started on todo app in node.js

### Day 6: June 27th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Read a few chapters of the nature of software development

**Thoughts**: Understanding the importance of deploying via feature to feature vs. project as a whole. When you deploy feature by feature, you know what you want it to do and how it should interact with other features. When is comes to planning for the project as a whole, you are focused on multiple parts at a time and don't have time to get into the entire ins and outs on what exactly what specific things should truly do. You don't give the features they deserve and in turn get the results you are expecting. When we set timelines and base getting the project at a certain time, features hav to be compromised in order to set those timelines. When we take it a feature by featue basis, we get the features we are expecting and even though we may not make the deadline, the project as a whole is of much better quality.

### Day 7: June 28th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished up my todo app using vue.js and node.js

**Thoughts**: Vue.js is very interesting. So far am I loving the feel of it. I like how everything for that component is in one file so it makes it easier to manage. I still need to do more practice to understand the in and out, but so far I am having fun with it.

### Day 9: July 1st, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Working through tic tac toe computer moves

**Thoughts**: Ran into a few bugs working on pinpointing the issue and fixing them

### Day 10: July 7th, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Got started on creating a react native app hiting a video game api.

**Thoughts**: Took a bit of break, had a hard time getting motivated. Also had a few things going on. But now I am back at it, and want to make a mobile video game search app. Expo snack is limited in what it can do so need to bring it down to my local environment.

### Day 11: July 8th, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Started a vue.js app that hits a video game api

**Thoughts**: Going to do the video game api using vue and make it mobile friendly. Brining Native down to my local env would cause me to downgrade npm. Vue is super cool. Plan is to render the info I am getting, add some authentication, and CSS it up

**Link(s) to work**: Haven't push it yet, some commented out code I need to delete


### Day 12: July 11th, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Have video games items rendering and added some CSS

**Thoughts**: Vue.js is really easy to understand and work with. Liking it a lot. Need to add auth

**Link(s) to work**: Still haven't pushed up code. Need to clean some files and componentize.

### Day 13: July 16th, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Was working on routes with vue, then stumbled upon [Dev Challenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/wBunSb7FPrIepJZAg0sY)

**Thoughts**: Dev Challenges is more front end focused but it gives me something to strive for without me trying to figure out projects on my own

**Link(s) to work**: [Rep](https://github.com/TRose2014/404-dev-challenge)

### Day 14: July 18th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started a node.js project using okta and express-generator. 

**Thoughts**: I really, really love working with node. Will wrap up this project and go back to do a dev challenge

### Day 15: July 20th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Working on Okta redirect uri bug

**Thoughts**: The url that I put in the okta dashboard is /users/callback but the redirect url in the browser is just localhost:3000. Added that to the okta dev console and still get 404 error. Need to revist.

**Link(s) to work**: Not pushed

### Day 16: July 20th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created another app for Okta and got that working fine. Need to go back to original app and fixing that issue

**Thoughts**: Once I get the original app to where I want it. Plan on pushing it to Github. Then I want to add OAuth for GitHub, LinkedIn, Google

**Thoughts**: Having a real fun time doing these challenges. I love doing logic puzzles, and this reminds me of those.

**Link(s) to work**: I really want to work on this next code challenge [Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenge/SrCTGbhwPRyHZSAGu)

### Day 19: August 9th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did a few more code challenges via Edabit

**Thoughts**: Haven't had a chance to work on my other apps but still wanted to get some coding in on the weekends.

**Link(s) to work**: Next challenge I want to work on [Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenge/s5Sz2ovKsvtGxNGgn)

### Day 20: August 15th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Decided to create an image uploader using serverless, AWS S3, AWS Lambda all in node.js, with the front end in vue.js

**Thoughts**: Created AWS account, installed serverless, configured aws cli. Sls deployed hello world [resources used was lambda and api gateway]. Next up is to set up s3 and upload and get items from bucket and view via front end.

**Link(s) to work**: Not deployed yet

### Day 21: August 18th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Can get objects from S3 bucket

**Thoughts**: However images are in bytes. Need to re-think and draw out architecture to understand what I want to accomplish

**Link(s) to work**:


### Day 22: August 21st, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Created lambda function that post and gets ingo from dynamo db while using serverless

**Thoughts**: Glad that I am getting use to cloud services. Serverless is super cool and learning a ton.

**Link(s) to work**: Will deploy to gitHub once clean up is done

### Day 23: Sept 5th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Set up a back-end for my front-end fact project.

**Thoughts**: Also since mlab will no longer be on Heroku, I moved my Remember Me collection over to Atlas. Everything is moved over, just need to update the info in repo. Lots I still need to work on when it comes to back-end, but enjoying the challenge. Next time plan on adding authentication in for fact repo since that is where I struggle with the most.

### Day 24: Jan 1st, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started second day of dev work on ecommerce project

**Thoughts**: I have been lax on keeping up with this log. But I will try to get better with the new year. Today I was struggling with connecting my backend to my mongodb. The connection string was throwing me off. What I learned is that the uri:
`mongodb+srv://rootName:password@cluster0-jjbdh.mongodb.net/defaultDB?retryWrites=true`

I have two databases all under the same username and password, so I was able to use my previous database url and just needed to change the defaultDB to the new database.

**Other notes**: I have been confused on what should go in a gitignore and what shouldn't, obviously .env files but when it comes to travis.yml and .eslint I wasn't sure. While working on this project I realized that if using travis.yml, obvi it needs to know how to build its VM so it can do it's thing. Additionally if you are having travis run `npm run lint`, it will also need access to your .eslint file. So I think having .eslints outside of the gitignore is fine.
### Day 25: Jan 30th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Got /signup route working. Need to still test /signin and /role route. Also did some front-end stuff. 

**Thoughts**: I was having a hard time  whether I wanted to do front end in Vue.js or React.js. My current job uses Vue so I wanted to get more experience with it, especially since Vue uses the store pattern. But I didn't want to put React to the waist side and completely forget about it. Espeically when it comes to React hooks, so in the end I decided to use React. I need to re-familiarize myself with React, but all and all it's good be back in the front-end.

### Day 26: Jan 31st, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Broke up original repo into two, backend and ui. I was trying to see if there were any advantages of having both live in one repo. But for me, I just prefer them both to be seperated out. It's easier to maintain, and allows me to focus on either or. Instead of trying to do both at the same time.

**Thoughts**: I am currently using axios to hit an endpoint rather than React's built in fetch. And I am curious as to the difference between the two, and also how it differs from superagent. Here is what I found:

| HTTP Clients      | Features |
| :---         |      :----:   |
| Axios        | Automatically converts the data to JSON, so you don’t have to<br> Uses data property<br> Has wide browser support;        |
| Fetch        | Need to covert data to JSON<br> Uses body property<br> Only supports Chrome 42+, Firefox 39+, Edge 14+, and Safari 10.1+          |
| Superagent   | Doesn't seem as popular anymore. [npmtrends](https://www.npmtrends.com/axios-vs-got-vs-request-vs-superagent)         |

### Day 27: Feb. 6th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Set up AWS S3 bucket a few days ago and added some testing images. Today I am using the s3 url to display the images on the ui

**Thoughts**: Now that I have the data I need. It's time to figure out how I want this home page to look. Need to go to the drawing board and discuss. Next would be to implement home page, connect sign up/sign in buttons. Then work on items page (all items and detailed items page)
