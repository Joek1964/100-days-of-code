# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 25, 2021 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Started the Responsive Web Design curriculum on FreeCodeCamp. Worked on Add imgs, Link to external pages, Link to internal section of page w/ anchor element.

**Thoughts:** I already took some courses on HTML, but this is a good review. Was distracted towards the end, but did end up taking good notes to be able to refer back to whenever.

###Day 1: April 26, 2021
#####
**Today's Progress**: I have completely finished the basic HTML and HTML5 course. Worked on images to links, unordered and ordered lists, text fields with placeholders,
creating form elements, submit buttons, required fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, the value attribute, checked by default, div elements, declaring doctype, 
and finally, defining head and body. I also started the Basic CSS course in the last few minutes. I worked on changing text color, using css selectors to style, 
using css class to style, and changing font sizes.

**Thoughts:** I learned a lot in this course that I didn't learn in a whole book on HTML and CSS. Mainly the many different user inputs. I feel much more comfortable with HTML as a whole now. My new goal is to try to finish a whole course a day, as I feel if I put my mind to it, I can definitely learn a lot in a short amount of time. Some of the elements weren't hard, but the practice was just what I needed to engrain them in my head. I have been taking notes of everything to refer to at any time.

###Day 2: April 27, 2021
#####
**Today's Progress**: I have almost completely finished the Basic CSS course. Specifically, I covered font families, google font importation, font drgrading, image sizing, borders, rounded borders, circular images, background colors to div elements, setting ID of element, using id to style element, adjusting padding and margin, including negative margin and shorthand notation, using attribute selector to style elements, overriding styles, using hex code, shorthand hex code, rgb values, creating custom css variables, and setting fallback values.

**Thoughts:** After getting through so much in one hour, I definitely feel much more comfortable with HTML and CSS as a whole. I saw things I either already knew or just have seen before, but I also saw a lot of new concepts. I look forward to using these on my projects. 

###Day 3: April 28, 2021
#####
**Today's Progress**: I have completely finished the Basic CSS course. I have also started the Applied Visual Design course and reach over half way. Topics covered include: inheriting css values with :root, text-align property, adjusting width of element, height, strong tag, underline tag, em tag, strikethrough tag, horizontal line tag, background-color of text, font-size, box-shadows, opacity, text-transform options, font-size, weight, line-height, hover state of anchor, relative position, absolute position, fixed position, float, z-index, and auto margin.

**Thoughts:** I finally feel like I'm starting to understand CSS. Picked up most of the work very quickly. Very useful.

###Day 4: April 29, 2021
#####
**Today's Progress**: Completely finished Applied Visual Design course, and started Applied Accessibility. Topics covered include: changing hue of color, creating linear-gradient, adding images to background, transform scale property, scale prop on hover, skew element on x and y axis, pseudo elements ::before and after, CSS keyframes and animation, animation count, timing function, and bezier curves.

**Thoughts:**Even with so much homework due tomorrow, I managed to get through the hour of code today. I learned alot about animation, and felt like the beginning of the applied accessibility course is a nice refresher to basic HTML formatting that will come in handy.

###Day 4: May 1, 2021
#####
**Today's Progress**: Not much progress. Learned about using tghe header, footer, adding the nav tag, add audio content, the figure element, and the label element.

**Thoughts:**: Unfortunately I forgot to do my hour of code yesterday, so I will be making it up when I have the time later. I didn't get to be very productive today. Had a long weekend, and it's not even Sunday yet. I do think I have a good understanding of what was covered, but wouldn't mind getting more insight on the topics.

###Day 5: May 2, 2021
#####
**Today's Progress**: Today I finished Applied Accessibility course and the Resoponsive Web Design Principles course. I just started the CSS Flexbox course. Topics covered include: fieldset element, accessible date picker, HTML5 time attribute, making elements visible only to screenreader, high contrast text, navigatible links, tabindex, media query, responsive images, typography response, display:flex, flex-direction.

**Thoughts:**: I am happy to move onto CSS Flexbox now, as I know this is one of the most important concepts in web development. I am starting to get the hang of it, but would like to practice it more.

###Day 6: May 3, 2021
#####
**Today's Progress**: Excellent. Finished both the CSS Flexbox course and CSS Grid course. Topics covered include justify-content, align-items, flex-wrap, flex-shrink, flex-grow, flex-basis, flex shorthand, order property, align-self, creating a grid, grid-template-columns/rows, css grid units, grid gaps, grid-column.row, justify-self, align-self, grid-template-area, grid-area with.without template, repeat function, minmax, auto-fill and auto-fit.

**Thoughts:** While I'm excited to have essentially gone through the learning courses of Responsive Web Design, my next project is making a tribute page using everything I've learned. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't nervous. It definitely is different when you're not being hand-held, but I'm sure this is just what I need. I look forward to working on this trubute page tomorrow!

###Day 7: May 4, 2021
#####
**Today's Progress**: More than an hour for once. Completed Tribute Page to Itsuki Hirata. Also came back later on free time to complete survey form page.

**Thoughts:** I really put a lot of work into this trubute page, but dang was it hard. Hardest thing I've done to date. I feel like I could make a freestyle one very well, but adapting to the requirements was tough. It forced me to watch a video on the subject, research example code, and learn a bit about other tags I haven't really memorized yet. Hardest part about this was using my creativity. Also created a survey form page as required of the Responsive Web Design course. Felt good, but a lot of the CSS I still don't see why need to be where they are. Also, had an issue getting a paragraph tag to show up above the radio buttons. Will come back to it later.
Edit** Finally found out the issue. Was missing a closing tag > on one of the options of the survey form. Finally got the page looking right.

###Day 8: May 5, 2021
#####
**Today's Progress**: Finished the Product Landing Page, but it still needs more polish. 

**Thoughts:** I got my product landing page to hit every requirement, but it still doesn't look the way I want it. The nav bar doesn't go all the way across the screen horizontally, as well as some other things. Will definitely work on it more later today after I finish my last exam.
