### Day 1:  January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress as Published on Medium.com **: https://medium.com/@Gretch/100daysofcode-day-1-github-startup-4846d6367015#.r778all04

**Thoughts:** I am ironing out wrinkles in my understanding of GitHub's push/pull system, but I am slowly getting it.  Need to find someone with whom to practice.

**Link to work:**  No separate code examples today (tutorials from Git and CodeSchool).



### Day 2:  January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress as Published on Medium.com **: https://medium.com/@Gretch/100daysofcode-day-2-hanging-on-to-github-281c1dc7ba46#.rb62be6yh

**Thoughts:**  Encountering some resistance with pushing my commits.  Will consider doing the CodeSchool "Git Real" course to improve my understanding and ability to use Git on an every day basis.

**Link to work:** No separate code examples today (tutorials from Git and CodeSchool).



### Day 3:  January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress as Published on Medium.com: **  https://medium.com/@Gretch/100daysofcode-day-3-markdown-more-github-d5d489ddf46d#.o5f1zo639

**Progress:** Played around with Markdown while I was working on the Spoon-Knife demo and this coding log.

**Thoughts:** Slow day with reading of documentation and working inside GitHub.  I will reach out to someone locally who can work with me in Git so that I can practice some techniques.

**Link to work:** No separate code examples today as I worked on closing and pulling/pushing on GitHub.



### Day 4:  January 6 and 7, 2017  (Started late on Friday, January 6th and just continued through the 7th-counting only as one day, though overlapped two calendar days)

**Today's Progress as Published on Medium.com **: https://medium.com/@Gretch/100daysofcode-day-4-reach-out-to-make-progress-c4e8c3a0d9c#.ceob2bt5t

**Thoughts:** Finalized some arrangements for GitHub practice with a friend, and I'm looking forward to that happening.  I continued my FreeCodeCamp journey by finishing a few lessons, including picking up a few new ones, and I have begun the 'Basic Front End Development Projects' section of FCC.  Last year I ploughed ahead to working in JavaScript, but I've decided to complete the curriculum in sequential order hence the return to the Basic Front End Dev Projects.  The next step is to get set up in CodePen and then I should be ready to compose the tribute page project.

### Day 5:  January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress as Published on Medium.com **: 

**Thoughts:** Today was a great day!  I was offered the opportunity to work with someone using GitHub, and did I ever accept that offer!  After an initial explanation of the different Git tools, and some examples of the power of Git, we then discussed workflows, code management, and a little bit about the relevant team management required as teams increase in their size. We then discussed the management principles of discipline and responsbility (for individuals and for teams).   The point was repeatedly made that Git is a set of tools, and that <i>how</i> Git is utilized resides with the individual user (or project manager) to discern according to the needs of a project or an organization.  Below are the links to the two suggested Git-related tools.

Using screen-sharing in a Google hangout, in conjunction with live file-changes in Git, I began to have a better understanding of the locations where the code is living at any point in time.  Just by this one discussion today I have such a clearer view of the ability of Git to track and manage code, and similar items.  I will be exploring Git throughout this Coding Challenge, and I am really honored and humbled that this person took the time on a Sunday afternoon to share knowledge.  As a means of thanks, I will be sharing this new-found knowledge with at least two other freeCodeCampers who are working with Git, and I have begun to contemplate how I can coordinate a GitHub tutorial for the local freeCodeCamp meetup.

Here's the other lesson beyond learning Git:  "Ask and ye shall receive, seek and ye shall find, knock and the door shall be opened."  This is an ancient proverb that is still standing the test of time.  Wherein is the rub, the difficulty?  In having the courage to ask, to seek, and to knock; and, perhaps, in having to ask more than one person.  In other words, do not give up.  In other words, be vulnerable to ask, persistent to seek, and finally courageous to step through the opened door.


**Link to Suggested Git-related Tools:**  
     1.  Kdiff3:  http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/      Kdiff3 is a diff & merge program with many other utilities
     2.  TortoiseGit:  https://tortoisegit.org/       TortoiseGit is a Windows shell, basically offers overlay functionality
     
**Link to work:** No separate code examples today as I worked on commenting/reviewing/pulling/pushing on GitHub!
