# 100 Days Of Code - Log

# Round 1.

### Day 1: June 8, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Finished half the Basic JavaScript chapter from the Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification (300 hours) on Free Code Camp. Then finished the Applied Visual Design chapter from the Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours) (still on Free Code Camp). 

**Thoughts:** JavaScript is not my friend yet. I still don't really understand its use, eventhough I think today's work helped a lot. I rewarded myself by going back to HTML/CSS and learned a lot about it, and had a lot of fun. It's what I feel is missing from JavaScript right now, the fun. I hope it'll come soon. 

**Link to work:** No link... I twitted though (@MagaliMilbergue).

### Day 2: June 9, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Basic JavaScript chapter from the Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification on Free Code Camp. Then had a little fun with HTML and CSS. 

**Thoughts:** I guess I understand Javascript a little better. I even found some of the exercises to be fun. (Yes, I actually had fun with javascript ! unbelievable!). I still don't really grasp what it can be usefull for in web developpment.... I guess I'll get it later. 
I also got some suggestions on twitter on how to have a little bit of fun with javascript and better grasp its usefullness so I'm really happy about that.
