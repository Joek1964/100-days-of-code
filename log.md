# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: July 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I read about variables,  `if...else`, `Boolean` objects, `slice()` method, and `parseInt()` in the Javascript documentation provided by [DevDocs](https://http://devdocs.io). I am taking a class called Responsive Website Basics provided to Coursera by the University of London, Goldsmiths and these were introduced recently. The example they used to apply these things was an e-reader. Also applied to Lyft for a software engineering job.

**Thoughts:** I really need to take it easy when applying. Right now, it's very emotionally draining.

### Day 1: July 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I updated a Python script for deleting old Tweets on Twitter to allow for the change in file formats (CSV to JSON) as can be seen in [this repository](https://github.com/lalaithan/delete-tweets) of mine. I was lead to this script from [the Medium article by Quincy Larson](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-delete-your-past-tweets-in-bulk-and-for-free-save-yourself-from-your-past-self-f8844cdbda2) detailing steps on deleting Tweets.

**Thoughts:** I wanted to start logging my work again to be more organized as to what I'm working on and what I've forgotten or neglected. I can't promise EVERY day, but I am going to be a better programmer with this set up!
