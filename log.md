# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 11, 2024

**Today's Progress:**: Completed the following modules at freeCodeCamp for C#:
                      - Call Methods From the .NET Class Library Using C#
                      - Install and Configure Visual Studio Code
                      - Trophy - Write Your First Code Using C#
                      - Guided Project - Calculate Final GPA

**Thoughts:** So far it all makes sense. Hope I don't get too lost in the future. Debating pausing C# and doing the "Start at the beginning" and the core freeCodeCamp classes.
