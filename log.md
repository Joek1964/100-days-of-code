# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2018, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started the HTML5 and CSS challenges for the Front End Development Certification

**Thoughts**: Thus far I'm not feeling too tested with these challenges. I'm sure that will change as I progress.

### Day 2: January 2, 2018, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the remaining HTML5 and CSS challenges and got through about 1/3 of Repsonsive Design With Bootstrap section.

**Thoughts**: Today I felt a slight tug not to do the challenges because I'm a little tired and Winter break with the wife and kids is starting to come to a close. In addition to that I ended up checking my work e-mail before starting so I began my hour somewhat distracted; not a good idea. Maybe tomorrow I'll try to give myself a few minutes to sort of reset my focus before starting.

### Day 3: January 3, 2018, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the remaining Responsive Design with Bootstrap challenges and got through about half of jQuery section.

**Thoughts**: Once again felt a slight resistance to starting the challenges, but I pushed through it. I didn't make the same mistake as yesterday by reading work e-mail. Nevertheless I was still somewhat distracted. The jQuery section is proving to be slightly more difficult than previous challenges mostly because I'm not that familiar with JavaScript syntax. On the upside, I do feel like I'm actually learning with these challenges so that's exciting.

### Day 4: January 4, 2018, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the remaining jQuery challenges and began work on the Build a Tribute Page project.

**Thoughts**: Didn't feel as much resistence today as I did in the previous couple of days. I've switched from Tron Legacy to Inception for music to code by; I think I like Tron a little better. :) The jQuery exercises were pretty straight forward, but I'm a little fuzzy on targeting child elements. I don't quite understand how the .target class with nth-child(n) magically finds the right element. That's just something I'll have to research a little more.

### Day 5: January 5, 2018, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Nearly completed the Tribute Page project.

**Thoughts**: Had a couple of interruption during my coding session so I spent a few addition minutes working on the tribute page project. Coming up with an idea for this project was a little difficult because I'm not that creative. I finaly came to the conclusion (right or wrong, but hopefully right) that the content of the tribute page is not what matters, it's demonstrating the ability to use what has been learned up to this point. Now I did have to google a couple of bootstrappy things, like block quotes, gradient backgrounds and rounded corners for my main "header" image. Hopefully tomorrow I'll have this baby wrapped up and be on to the next thing.

### Day 6: January 6, 2018, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Tribute Page and started the Personal Portfolio Webpage project.

**Thoughts**: Ok, so now I'm starting to feel the burn. The creative aspect of these projects is still getting in the way. Surely this will ease up as I progress and I'll over-think things a little less. Tomorrow I'm going to get out a piece of paper and sketch the portfolio page based on the user stories. I think it'll help quite a bit if I can get an idea on paper so I can actually see it. That should give me a little better aim.

### Day 7: January 7, 2018, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Focused on the Personal Portfolio Webpage project. Almost completed the first iteration of the navbar.

**Thoughts**: I sketched out on paper what I think the portfolio page should look like. That has helped quite a bit as I don't think putting ideas from brain to keyboard works well for me. On a slightly different note, it looks like I'll have quite a few placeholders for work since I don't have much to showcase. I should put the tribute page on there. Ended up spending most of the coding session struggling with the navbar. The bootstrap docs are ok, but I need it explained to me like I'm a 5 year old. :) I feel like I cheated a bit by "borrowing" some navbar code from the bootstrap site. Now that I have the portfolio site laid out, I'll dig to the navbar just to make sure I understand it.

### Day 8: January 8, 2018, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Still working on the Personal Portfolio Webpage project. The navvbar is functional including the abilitly collapse on smaller screen sizes. I've added filler text for all sections of the site and started work on smooth scrolling. Tomorrow I plan to finish the smooth scrolling stuff and start building out the first section of the site.

**Thoughts**: I have a little better handle on how the navbar works in bootstrap thanks to a couple of YouTube videos. I'm not a huge fan of the way bootstrap requires the use of the navbar class; there must be a better way! :)

### Day 9: January 9, 2018, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Ended up spending about 1.25 hours in this session. Continuing to work on the Personal Portfolio Webpage project. I did manage to complete the smooth scrolling and implement the javascript necessary to make the nav links appear active. This works when clicking a nav link or scrolling down to a give section of the page. With that out of the way, I should be able to start building out the first section of the site.

**Thoughts**: Arrggghhh! The navbar smooth scrolling stuff really killed my productivity today. I feel like I understand about %25 percent of what I've coded up thus far which is a little discouraging. Today is probably the first day I've actually felt beaten up by code. lol I'll try and get a good nights sleep tonight and be more refreshed tomorrow.

### Day 10: January 10, 2018, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Work on the portfolio page continues. The about section is nearly complete. I'd like to add a better profile pic and a nice background image tomorrow. Once that's done I'll be ready to start the "work" section.

**Thoughts**: Today was a pretty productive day. I did run into a little blocker when using the img-responsive class and padding on an image. This [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9409632/border-radius-and-padding-not-playing-nice#) helped me resolve the issue. Also discovered the [lead class](https://bootstrapdocs.com/v3.3.5/docs/css/#lead-body-copy) which is working well for the text in my about section. Definitely putting the read, search part of read, search, ask to good use.

### Day 11: January 11, 2018, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Work on the portfolio page continues. Instead of sprucing up the about section I just went ahead and started to build the work section of the site. In the work section I'm just using the bootstrap [thumbnail class](https://bootstrapdocs.com/v3.3.6/docs/components/#thumbnails-default) along with a little extra html for a parahraph and button. I tried this neat little utiltiy from [holderjs](http://holderjs.com/)to add placeholder image for one of the project pages. I just made color blocks for the rest because the sizing behavior is a little strange. For example, a 400x400px png file displays as the same size as a 400x275 placeholder from holderjs; it's odd. Switched to azure blob storage to host all my images. 


**Thoughts**: Another focused and productive day, I'd say. I find myself spending about 1.5 - 2 hours a night on this project including github and twitter updates. Feeling like I should reign that in and stick with 1 hour and just stop no matter where I am in my coding session. I'll try that tomorrow night.
