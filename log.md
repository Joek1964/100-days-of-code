# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Set up 100-days-of-code repo and joined FreeCodeCamp. I completed 25 challenges related to setting up my account, HTML, and CSS

**Thoughts:** I had a lot of velocity since I did most of the stuff required for the first challenges already--but I needed the HTML review. I wasn't planning on starting all of this until tomorrow, but since I had the day off, I couldn't help myself. There were a few things I learned that weren't covered at Codecademy (or I forgot everything...)

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the HTML challenges "Link to External Page with Anchor Element" to "Style the HTML body element" = about 25 challenges.

**Thoughts:** Again--a lot of velocity but I learned some new stuff today. All of the form element stuff was new to me. I'm still not sure how it actually connects to a database, but I'll figure that out someday. Maybe tomorrow! I feel like I should take a few days after completing the HTML track to actually mess around with my own code. Maybe even experiment on some web pages at work. Otherwise I'll forget this stuff. Also--I like the dead link feature. That was new to me as well. And I even found a dead link on a website built by a friend today ;)

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the HTML track in FreeCodeCamp and started a basic codepen.

**Thoughts:** I'm kinda bummed that my progress (3 day streak!) is not showing up in Git--but I guess I don't fully grasp it yet. I need to actually start working on projects. However, my freecodecamp log is really nice to look at! I finished the HTML track and have experimented a bit with HTML. I've also been referencing [w3schools.com](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_link.asp) for some help and new ideas. New ideas being one--how to change the color of a link while a cursor is hovering over it. Also kept focus listening to [Pogo's new album](https://youtu.be/BwyY5LdpECA) today.

### Day 3: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Messed with HTML codepen. Trying to incorporate everything I learned in the tutorial.

**Thoughts:** I am continuing to make my "Hello World!" website as silly as possible. Right now I'm trying to make a fake website menue but I'm having trouble figuring out how I can force the links to stay the same color after they've been visited. I only want that effect on the menu though. I didn't quite figure it out, but I think I'm close. I think it has to do with the style hierarchy. I also experimented with div's and padding. I want to figure out how to get a 2- column layout so I can have side-by-side boxes. Tomorrow I want to see if I can start a new repo with the code for this website project, mostly because I want to show that I'm making headway on Git! Especially since I technically didn't do anything on FCC. Maybe I should do one tutorial so I at least get a mark for the day...ok officially started bootstrap. Whew!

### Day 4: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Wrote an excessive amount of HTML at work. And finished the day with some Bootstrap.

**Thoughts:** Ok so technically it's already Saturday, but it's been a long day, ok!? I think I put in 120% effort. In short, I created a workaround for a Drupal issue we've had at work for a while. I know this isn't supposed to be work projects, but technically this is outside my scope of responsibilities anyways. So I fixed our homepage issue. And then I had a lot of personal stuff to do today, so I didn't get home until 12:45 and wanted to get some FCC tutorials in. We'll see what I remeber tomorrow.

### Day 5: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added more to my Hello World project, and created some new files in Github to track this project.

**Thoughts:** I've added a bit more to my Hello World project. My goal is do add a little bit of code from each tutorial into this page so that I get a little bit of extra practice. I might skip the FCC tutorials today since last night's work actually counted for today. So didn't learn much new stuff today, but I worked with some new HTML classes and got better at creating images.

### Day 6: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Lots of Bootstrap today, and practiced creating Branches in Github.

**Thoughts:** My favorite thing I learned today was adding font awesome icons to my projects and also finally figuring out how bootstrap columns work (just make sure it all adds up to 12!) There are still some mysteries--there were two classes mentioned in a tutorial that made no sense and weren't explained: see "Style Text Inputs as Form Controls." I also got my husband coding too, which is pretty awesome. We've been watching antiques roadshow with our computers out. I can't wait to learn more stuff and work on my own projects.

### Day 7(+1): January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished Bootstrap and started the jQuery tutorial!

**Thoughts:** Sadly, I missed a day of code yesterday. I ended up having a very busy day at work and had committed to hanging out with friends for a while in the evening--and when I got home it would've been a bad call to start coding. What matters is that I got right back into it today. Not sure if I'm wrapping my mind around both of these languages yet, but I guess I'll revisit them in my personal projects.

### Day 8(+1): January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished off jQuery tutorial!

**Thoughts:** Today I coded with some Pride and Prejudice in the background to make up for the indecent dialogue happening at a certain press conference today. I made it pretty quickly through the tutorials, but I'm not sure if I would be able to apply everything I learned quickly. But I guess that's what practice is for.

### Day 9(+1): January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read Javascript

**Thoughts:** I didn't really code today--but I did a lot of reading code and figuring out how Javascript works on one of the websites I manage (after hours, promise!) I'm proud to say it actually made sense for once--though I'd love to know more about how the responsive template works.

### Day 10(+1): January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Testing Javascript

**Thoughts:** I did some more testing on the Trumba spuds I am experimenting on at work. I need some help deploying them, but I look forward to doing it next week.

### Day 11(+2): January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started Tribute Page

**Thoughts:** I started work on my tribute page. I was surprised to learn that the example page was mostly done in Bootstrap. I was excited to use HTML--I could viusalize it pretty easily that way, but Bootstrap is something else. I started work on the framework of the page, but I had to consult Bootstrap's documentation quite a bit.

### Day 12(+2): January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on tribute page

**Thoughts:** More wading through Bootstrap. I'm starting to use stuff that wasn't covered in the tutorials, and thinking maybe I should go back to basics and layout the page again.

### Day 13(+2): January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on tribute page

**Thoughts:** I started my tribute page over from scratch today. I went back to the tutorials and tried to build a better framework before dropping content in. I ended up with a similar mess. It's hard to put something down until you have it just the way you want it...

### Day 14(+2): January 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on tribute page

**Thoughts:** I added a lot of content to my tribute page today. I'm still having a lot of formatting issues, but I think I'll troubleshoot it all tomorrow. In my line of work, content is half the battle. So now I just need to make it look nicer.

### Day 15(+2): January 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Wrapped up tribute page

**Thoughts:** Finally figured out some of the issues I was having with my tribute page. I'm still having trouble with the margins--I think I don't fully comprehend the grid system in Bootstrap quite yet. But overall I think it was a good first attempt at a responsive page. And I'm also giving myself permission to not be a complete perfectionist. Maybe next week I'll even peek into the example code if the solution doesn't come to me in an Aha moment. Feels good to wrap a project though.

### Day 16(+2): January 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started Portfolio Page

**Thoughts:** I got very deep into creating my profile project page while watching the Fellowship of the Ring this evening. It was about the shittiest day I could imagine so I was escaping into a cave of code. Or something like that. Anyways, I figured out how to build a navigation bar using Bootstrap. And I blocked out some other elements in the page. Tomorrow I want to figure out how to make background images, and maybe some thumbnails for projects.

### Day 17(+2): January 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on Portfolio Page

**Thoughts:** Exhausted but still coding! Women's march today plus a concert, but still wanted to find some time to code today. I did a few hours yesterday, so I kinda shorted myself today. But my brain is pretty taxed. So it's bedtime.

### Day 18(+3): January 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on Portfolio Page

**Thoughts:** POOP I missed a day, but I did a lot of cool projects on the side, like reading and editing video and audio for one of my music ensembles. And I got a workout in too. Today I taught myself how to put a background image in my website, and then I treated the text with a shadow so that it would be readable.

### Day 19(+3): January 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on Portfolio Page

**Thoughts:** Wow after a bit of frustration I realized i needed to add the jQuery library to my project in order to get the responsive nav to work properly. I fixed up the design a bit. I will have to revist my CSS--I'd like to be more consistent with the headers that I'm using. Right now I'm creating a lot of custom classes that could probably be repeated a bit more. Productive day, though! I'm glad I'm able to shut out the world a bit and focus on these projects. I'm having trouble doing that at my actual job. :P
