# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 3, 2017 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've trail through the html, css and bootstrap parts on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I've started coding for a year or so, so I have a good foundation in html & css, and need to move forward.

### Day 2: Jan 4, 2017 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've finish bootstrap & jQuery lessons from FreeCodeCamp, and started working on a one page portfolio.

**Thoughts**: I'm currently not fond of the current iteration of bootstrap 4 beta 5 support for flexbox, there was many frustration points today.
