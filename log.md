# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I get the geolocation from the browser and I tested the openweather API for my project on FCC.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with JavaScript and JQuery, why? Because I've stopped for a long time without code anything. It's a piss off, really. Don't do that. Now, I need to recover again, study more to understand what I'm missing.

**Link to work:** I will up my repo for my GitHub.
