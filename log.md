# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 7th, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Finished the last 52% of the Applied Accessabilty portion of FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design track

**Thoughts:** I have not practiced coding in a while and so it was tough starting off in the middle of the section like that.


### Day 2: June 8, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: I got to 50% on FreeCodeCamp's CSS Grid portion of the Responsive Web Design Track. 

**Thoughts**: Things are starting to look more familiar to when a did html more regularly. I love this feeling.

### Day 3: June 9th, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
I finished the CSS Grid portion of the responsive Web Design track on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**:
I felt detached from this session. I think I was excited about almost being done with the track. Just 5 projects to go!


### Day 4: June 10th, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
I started my FreeCodeCamp tribute page project on Zelda Barbour Wynn Valdes.

**Thoughts**:
Html is what I am most comfortable and familiar with so after a few days getting reacquainted, this felt ok. I realized time flew when I started this project. The user stories involving divs tripped me up so I will need to practice that.
