# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Find out this challenge interesting, why decided to join it.
My main goals is to extend and improve my basic knowledge around modern javascript frameworks and tools, which are currently using across many companies, despite they are basicly build above vanila javascript). I mean React, Angular, Vue, Ember, Ionic and probably not from this list - Electron (found a tutorial on Corsetra, want to try it some time later) and in other side, I want to become a self-taught full-stack developer, which means, that I must make my knowledge in PHP (at least) deeper. But ideally I would to learn other backend language, for example Ruby/RoR.

### fireChat project
tutorial from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-j0LVc-zLh0
Created project from scratch via Angular CLI, set up services and a buch of components, which are will be a skeleton for chat. added necessary components from firebase and set firebase db up.
Also, struggling from unbuildable error atm (stopped at 20:01) - how it possible to build up app if my command line throw out error linked to empty (unmodified) services? also, Google recently updated their FireBase again, so all information in this tutorial is lightly outdated, so I must dig into google again to figure out how to make all DB requests up to date, like it was already with another app builded by Gary Simon from coursetro (https://coursetro.com/posts/code/31/How-to-Make-an-Angular-Firebase-Chat-App) which I tried some time ago
