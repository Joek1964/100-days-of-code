# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 01, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Built a drumkit in Javascript

**Thoughts:** To get me started without getting trapped in indecision about what to learn I am working through Wes Bos great 30 day challenge on vanilla javascript. shout out to [Wes Bos](https://javascript30.com/)

Discovered a nifty web tool to discover the keycodes of any [keypressed](http://keycode.info/)

### Day 1: January 02, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: CSS Clock

**Thoughts:** Realised how little I know of the css transition, and transform properties. Interesting to 
see how much can be achieved with a little bit of maths and css.

### Day 2: January 03, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: CSS Variables

**Thoughts:** Using the new CSS variables syntax and some clever use of javascript to dynamically change the
variables on the fly.

### Day 3: January 04, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Graphqlgen

**Thoughts:** Took a break from Wes Bos tonight, looking at graphql gen. I am working on a side project which uses Graphql and prisma. BUT I am very frustrated with understanding and writing resolvers, so hoping that
the library graphqlgen from prisma helps me solve the automatic code generation for resolver boilerplate.

### Day 4: January 05, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Graphql and resolvers

**Thoughts:** Very frustrating. One would think that this would be easier to use. But hey ho, I guess I must be a fronteer. I will keep pluggin away at thsi Graphql thing.
