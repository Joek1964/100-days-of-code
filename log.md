# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Set up 100-days-of-code repo and joined FreeCodeCamp. I completed 25 challenges related to setting up my account, HTML, and CSS

**Thoughts:** I had a lot of velocity since I did most of the stuff required for the first challenges already--but I needed the HTML review. I wasn't planning on starting all of this until tomorrow, but since I had the day off, I couldn't help myself. There were a few things I learned that weren't covered at Codecademy (or I forgot everything...)

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the HTML challenges "Link to External Page with Anchor Element" to "Style the HTML body element" = about 25 challenges.

**Thoughts:** Again--a lot of velocity but I learned some new stuff today. All of the form element stuff was new to me. I'm still not sure how it actually connects to a database, but I'll figure that out someday. Maybe tomorrow! I feel like I should take a few days after completing the HTML track to actually mess around with my own code. Maybe even experiment on some web pages at work. Otherwise I'll forget this stuff. Also--I like the dead link feature. That was new to me as well. And I even found a dead link on a website built by a friend today ;)

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the HTML track in FreeCodeCamp and started a basic codepen.

**Thoughts:** I'm kinda bummed that my progress (3 day streak!) is not showing up in Git--but I guess I don't fully grasp it yet. I need to actually start working on projects. However, my freecodecamp log is really nice to look at! I finished the HTML track and have experimented a bit with HTML. I've also been referencing [w3schools.com](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_link.asp) for some help and new ideas. New ideas being one--how to change the color of a link while a cursor is hovering over it. Also kept focus listening to [Pogo's new album](https://youtu.be/BwyY5LdpECA) today.

### Day 3: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Messed with HTML codepen. Trying to incorporate everything I learned in the tutorial.

**Thoughts:** I am continuing to make my "Hello World!" website as silly as possible. Right now I'm trying to make a fake website menue but I'm having trouble figuring out how I can force the links to stay the same color after they've been visited. I only want that effect on the menu though. I didn't quite figure it out, but I think I'm close. I think it has to do with the style hierarchy. I also experimented with div's and padding. I want to figure out how to get a 2- column layout so I can have side-by-side boxes. Tomorrow I want to see if I can start a new repo with the code for this website project, mostly because I want to show that I'm making headway on Git! Especially since I technically didn't do anything on FCC. Maybe I should do one tutorial so I at least get a mark for the day...ok officially started bootstrap. Whew!

### Day 4: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Wrote an excessive amount of HTML at work. And finished the day with some Bootstrap.

**Thoughts:** Ok so technically it's already Saturday, but it's been a long day, ok!? I think I put in 120% effort. In short, I created a workaround for a Drupal issue we've had at work for a while. I know this isn't supposed to be work projects, but technically this is outside my scope of responsibilities anyways. So I fixed our homepage issue. And then I had a lot of personal stuff to do today, so I didn't get home until 12:45 and wanted to get some FCC tutorials in. We'll see what I remeber tomorrow.

### Day 5: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added more to my Hello World project, and created some new files in Github to track this project.

**Thoughts:** I've added a bit more to my Hello World project. My goal is do add a little bit of code from each tutorial into this page so that I get a little bit of extra practice. I might skip the FCC tutorials today since last night's work actually counted for today. So didn't learn much new stuff today, but I worked with some new HTML classes and got better at creating images.

### Day 6: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Lots of Bootstrap today, and practiced creating Branches in Github.

**Thoughts:** My favorite thing I learned today was adding font awesome icons to my projects and also finally figuring out how bootstrap columns work (just make sure it all adds up to 12!) There are still some mysteries--there were two classes mentioned in a tutorial that made no sense and weren't explained: see "Style Text Inputs as Form Controls." I also got my husband coding too, which is pretty awesome. We've been watching antiques roadshow with our computers out. I can't wait to learn more stuff and work on my own projects.
