**Today's Progress**: `#100daysOfCode` day 5:

I wanted to visualise custom multi-day events in a calendar for a while, let's see how it goes.

is pretty easy to use, it can be embedded in a few lines of code.
I'll have many ideas how to fine tune it...

**Today's Progress**: `#100DaysOfCode` Day 6

I made a script to get size of folders per date from an s3 bucket using `#s3curl` and visualized it with `#plotlyJS`

I had around 1 hour time limit for learning and coding. Besides a nasty typo in "marker" based pagination, everything worked on the first try üéâ

**Today's Progress**: `#100DaysOfCode` Day 8

Today I got an hour to polish my calendar viewer that I wrote about a few days ago. It still has a long way to go but now it's usable enough for my needs.
I've added a github action to deploy it, and fixed some onboarding issues.
