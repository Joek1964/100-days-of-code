# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 20, 2019 (Test)
##### (trying this out before this will be replaced by Day 0 tonight)

**Today's Progress**: <!--Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.--> 
  I need a project chosen to have workable improvements to it.

**Thoughts:**  <!-- I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.--> 
  The first part is selecting the project and working on it after work hours.

**Link to work:** [Calculator App](http://www.example.com) 
  This link needs to be established, github pages ??

### Day 1: March 21, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Reached out to two ppl on twitter  @EvanEichelberg2  @cvillafraz 
                      The challenge seems to only do projects. Lets do those projects then. 
                      Spending time on FCC even counts. Exercism was also used today.
                      

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

                      I am not sure if spending time on FCC even counts.
