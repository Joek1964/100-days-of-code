# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 1: April 26, 2018- Thursday 

**Today's Progress**: Refreshed myself via FreeCodeCamp, on Compound assignments w/ augumented addition, multiplication, subtraction and division. These operators do both a mathematical operation, and assignment in 1 step. Also refreshed on escaping literal quotes in strings by using a backslash. 

**Thoughts:** I have to ensure that I constantly code. As soon as I begin practicing it all comes back, but I have to stop with the long breaks in between studying, and coding.

Finding the length of a string (.length). & using bracket notation[] to find a character in a string.
