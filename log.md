# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 16, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Solved "Counting Duplicates" http://www.codewars.com/kata/counting-duplicates/train/javascript using map() and indexOf(). Now I want to solve it using other methods: reduce(), filter(), forEach() and recursion.

**Thoughts:** I think those methods are the core of JS programming, the better I know them the better my code will be.
