-I learnt about Javascript in-built Objects(JSON & localStorage) - .JSON which is used to send data between computers and to store data.
-I also learnt about javascript auto-boxing feature where javascript wraps other data-types in a box making them special objects.

**Thoughts:** Omo! today had a alot of friction. I honestly just wanted to do something else asides coding. But when I eventually started I locked in! Still trying to assimilate the basics of javascript.
