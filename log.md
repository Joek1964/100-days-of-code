**Today's Progress**: [posted on Twitter] 4 hours on Day 1, whoop! Not sure how to use this log, though... https://github.com/Heathyr/100-days-of-code ‚Ä¶. I forked it - now what, haha??? #CodeNewbie #100DaysofCode

**Thoughts:** Struggling with CSS, don't fully understand positioning

Day 3: January 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: [posted on Twitter] Day 3, woo-hoo! My hour today consisted mainly of trying to pound the finer points of the box model into my brain. Sad but true, haha. Whatever - I'm claiming the win for putting in my time! #CodeNewbie #100DaysOfCode

Day 11: January 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: [posted on Twitter] Day 11 - Loving @freeCodeCamp's Applied Visual Design track! Finally starting to understand how positioning works instead of flying blind and crossing my fingers, haha üòç #CodeNewbie #100DaysOfCode

Finished @freeCodeCamp's Applied Visual Design track, whoop-whoop! Really starting to love CSS & excited to learn more animation üòÉ #CodeNewbie #100DaysOfCode

Day 12: January 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: [posted on Twitter] Day 12 - Completed Applied Accessibility portion of #freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification ü•≥ #CodeNewbie #100DaysOfCode

**Thoughts** Really enjoyed learning more about internet accessibility. It got me thinking about my uncle who is blind. I would love to help the world be more accessible for people like him. I've thought a lot about how our super-technical, internet-driven world leaves so many people behind, but in the past my thoughts have focused on older generations and those in poverty who can't afford computers and other tech. This lesson has reminded me how much differently-abled people miss out on as well.

Day 15: January 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: [posted on Twitter] Day 15 - Been working hard on my @freeCodeCamp tribute page. Trying to add a CSS collage using this guide: https://css-tricks.com/seamless-responsive-photo-grid/ ‚Ä¶, but can't get bottoms to even up. Any ideas? #CodeNewbie #100DaysofCode #WomenWhoCode

Day 16: January 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: [posted on Twitter] Day 16 - Just finished my first @freeCodeCamp project: https://heathyr.github.io/tribute/ . Bit off a little more than I could chew, but am enjoying the results, for the most part üòÄüåàüéá ü•≥ #CodeNewbie #100DaysOfCode #WomenWhoCode

**Thoughts** Love my tribute page - it's so colorful and happy! I had to let go of the CSS collage because I couldn't get the bottoms to line up, but I'm proud of myself for stretching well beyond my comfort zone. As a workaround, I designed the collage in another program and used the jpg for my site.

Now that I'm designing things that bring me joy, I'm enjoying this whole coding thing a lot more. Also, doing this tribute to a Maori trans activist has shown me that coding can not only be fun, but can contribute to the world in a positive way. I'm looking forward to helping out some non-profits with some web dev when I can :)

Day 17: January 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finally took the time to figure out how this GitHub log works - yay! Filled in all the progress from previous days, as recorded on Twitter. As for coding, I played a bit more with my tribute page but ultimately reverted back to the original because my experiments in simplifying the responsive CSS were unsuccessful. I tweaked the Rogue Pickings site into a perfect starter site for an upcoming vegan food truck business in Daytona Beach, replacing the green beans image with a beautiful full-color fruits & veggies pic I found on Adobe Stock. Loving the new, colorful look :)

**Thoughts** I feel so good about the vegan food truck site! It's beautiful and will give this struggling small business owner a leg up :)

And one last thought: I just realized I forgot to create a branch on my forked repo before I started all these updates - doh! Sooo... gonna have to remember that next time.

Day 18: January 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: [as posted on Twitter] Not the most productive day, but did chip away on my portfolio site design üôÇ #100DaysOfCode

**Thoughts** Do I really need to make a branch of my branch to update this log, I wonder? Also, I guess I shouldn't worry about doing a pull request for my own individual progress log, haha. It was good practice, though!

Day 20: January 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: [as posted on Twitter] Day 20 and I have questions, haha... If anyone would like to take a stab at this one, I'd be much obliged: https://stackoverflow.com/q/54331347/10734749 ‚Ä¶ Please & Thank You ü§ì @StackOverflow @freeCodeCamp #CodeNewbie #100DaysOfCode #WomenWhoCode

[as posted on Twitter] Day 20 is done... spent most of it on my portfolio site design, building the HTML structure and starting on CSS ü•≥ #CodeNewbie #100DaysOfCode #WomenWhoCode

Day 21: January 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: [as posted on Twitter] Day 21. Been thinking about this a lot as I embark upon my coding journey... #CodeNewbie #100DaysOfCode #WomenWhoCode #CodingJrney  [Quote pic attached: "The journey of a thousand steps begins with a single step."]

[as posted on Twitter] Day 21 was spent dabbling with various approaches to my portfolio site's CSS. It's fun to experiment - I always learn something - but I'm eager to finish now & start new projects üòç #CodeNewbie #100DaysOfCode #WomenWhoCode

Day 22: January 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: [as posted on Twitter] Day 22 - So close on my portfolio site! Bit off way more than I could chew designing things I have no idea how to code yet and so had to go back and simplify, haha. But I've been learning a lot üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíªüéâ #CodeParty #100DaysOfCode #CodeNewbie #WomenWhoCode

Day 23: January 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: [as posted on Twitter] Day 23 - Whelp, tried to fly too high... Broke my code adding an overlay. Will have to fix it tomorrow since I've spent all day coding and my eyes can't take anymore, haha. üíªü§™ #CodeNewbie #100DaysOfCode #WomenWhoCode

**Thoughts**

Day 24: January 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Very thankful I was able to reach out to Ann@Skillcrush for answers to my overlay questions! It was so helpful and even though I was very close to the solution, I was so wrapped up in it that I'm not sure I would have figured it out on my own. So now my portfolio site is ready to go! I just have a few tweaks I'd like to make to one of the sites I'm showing as a work sample and then I'll publish. Went ahead and created my hello@heathyrjclift.com email. Might also tweak the "about me" language, but I'll take care of those odds and ends tomorrow.

Practiced with Git a bit as well - re-cloned this 100 Days of Code repo because I seem to have set it up incorrectly before (think it must be because I altered the name of the cloned folder - won't do that again!) I definitely need to get better about updating this log every day and not just Twitter, so I can keep my Git/GitHub skills sharp. Going to keep my new *log-updates* branch open so I can make the changes quicker and easier :)

**Thoughts** After the code marathons the last few days, it was nice to ease off today. Actually got some work done on a new screenplay - it was good to switch gears!

Day 25: January 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: [posted on Twitter] Fixed yesterday's code breakage with the help of Ann @Skillcrush (THANK U!), practiced with Git/GH to keep those skills sharp, and worked on my latest Viz Design class - whoop-whoop!!! ü•≥ #CodeNewbie #100DaysOfCode #WomenWhoCode #codejourney

Day 26: January 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Spent some time on my new Visual Design course - starting to learn UX/UI and loving it! Sometimes coding feels like a slog, but designing is my happy place so it's great to switch off between the two. Also played around with fixing my tribute site, but still have much work to do there before I can feel good about including it on my portfolio site - especially now that I'm learning design principles.

**Thoughts** Just realized my Twitter posts have been off by a day... must have forgotten to post one day and that threw the count all off, haha. Yet another reason to keep up with this GH log!

Day 27: January 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Worked on my design classes & totally redesigned/rebuilt my tribute project to a static site with a much nicer design than the responsive version üéâ Now I must üò¥

**Thoughts** Had to let go of the responsive version of the tribute site, preferring to focus on the best design possible within my current coding skillset. Really enjoying the new page :)

Day 28: January 31, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Got a lot of practice on Git/GitHub today - finally figured out the workflow and why my gh-pages updates weren't working. So now I've created a TextEdit file with my own little cheatsheet guide to updating existing repositories. Went back through all my other projects to fix the issues and deleted/re-created my Static Tribute site. Also made some last tweaks on my milestone portfolio project and created a GitHub repo for it.

**Thoughts** So... I was all set to post my portfolio page for feedback until I saw some that others posted, haha. Think I'm suffering from "I'm not  good enough" syndrome before I can even get to the Imposter Syndrome everyone talks about. Anyway, not sure I want to post it for feedback right now... Maybe I'll just take the plunge and upload the files to my site. At least that way there will be no going back/chickening out if I get some tough criticism, haha. I don't want to strand myself in an endless revision process before I even have the guts to publish.
