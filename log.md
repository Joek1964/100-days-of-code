# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did a GitHub tutorial, did some Javascript FreeCodeCamp lessons.

**Thoughts:** I wasn't going to commit to #100DaysOfCode right away because I had other things I wanted to do first.  But if not now, when?  I feel pretty good about what I learned in GitHub and FreeCodeCamp. 

**Tweet:** R1D1 - Starting #100DaysOfCode Did some FreeCodeCamp Javascript and GitHub tutorial today.  I was a good coder in the 20th century but it's been a couple of decades #OldDogNewTricks

### Day 2: December 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More Javascript FreeCodeCamp lessons.

**Thoughts:** Feeling a little weird about doing lessons instead of working on my codepen projects, especially given that I have not finished one of the projects.  But getting back into the swing of daily coding is important, and it's what I can do right now.  Should feel good about that.  I know I'll return to codepen to finish at some point soon.

**Tweet:** R1D2 of @_100DaysOfCode is all about the Basic JavaScript module of @freeCodeCamp.  Lessons, not project building, but many project activities loom just over the horizon.
