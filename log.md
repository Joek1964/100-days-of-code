# 100 Days Of Code - Log
//Victorious Foulks: Coding Captains log// 
### Day 1: July 21, Wednesday:

**What I Learnt Today** Getting a better understanding of using Git bash's commands, 
learned how to shallow copy and deep copy Objects in JavaScript, 
and better and manipulating arrays in JavaScript.

**Thoughts** I'm getting in deep with JavaScript now, but i feel like there is so many other Coding Languages that I have to learn or keep up with.
Git Bash is giving me a hard time, I need to Review my CSS and a bit of HTML, and JavaScript is starting to get hard.
My plan of action is to learn more Git Hub/Git Bash Thursday and Friday, and then Saturday lean in more to JavaScript for those Kew concepts in my meeting with Jamal Saturday. 
Then Sunday I'll chill and try and review/build things with HTML and CSS.

**Feeling** A bit intimidated, but I am hopefull and still ambitious when it comes to coding oppurtunities!

### Day 2: July 22, Thursday:

**What I Learnt Today** So I finally fixed my local git repo for my JavaScript class. I believe the original mistake I made was basically making clones of the my Head.
I git reset that and made sure that the connection to the remote repo was still there, so its all set now! I also set up another workspace on visual studio to practice HTML and CSS.
I was able to make multiple files and connect them, the only problem is that you i can't see how CSS is affecting my HTML. 
That will be something I have to fix.

**Thoughts** memories of the code I ran earlier in the year are flooding my mind. I am beginning to remember how to write html and css!
I am eager to try and apply some JavaScript to these pages to see what cool stuff I can do! ( I know tha will come with time though, I am in a JavaScript class for goodness sakes XD)

**Feeling** Growing in Confidences!

### Day 3&4: July 23-24, Friday and Saturday

**What I Learnt Today** I finished my Object homework!! Boy does it feel good, after I spoke with Matina I realized that I was trying to go about invoking the object within the function.
alls ya gotta do is set the value of the property to the parameters of the function that you want it to hold... its simple if you are doing it lol. 
Also learned that when you are calling certain info outside of the function so that the parameters have value is called an Argument

**Thoughts** I.Am.SO.Happy I solved the rest of the homework. It felt as though after I got over that one question I could figure out the rest. 
When I get aa chance it would be good to make up some random functions to practice, that way I know how to manipulate them better.

**Feeling**Happy that I understand the homework better.

### Day 5: July 25, Sunday

**What I Learnt Today** I attempted the HangMan project in HTML and JavaScript. I learnt about while...loops and how to intergrate loops with array.join into an array to make it display other characteres
other than the typical["","",""], and instead would have it pop up as a prompt with just underscores.

**Thoughts** Everything seems correct with my code, but trying to get Visual Studio code to preview it and run it how I want to see it is a challenge,
I'll have to review to make sure it is written correctly, or just find a different IDE so I can display my code.

**feeling** happy to have done it, but a little frustrated with VS code.

### Day 6: July 26, Monday

**What I Learnt Today** I learned alot today so I'm just gonna put it into an array. <script>const learntSubjects= ["currying","complex Functions","Scope & Closures"
,"using anonymous functions in a object that goes back into a function"]</script>.

**Thoughts** had my JavaScript class today. We covered ALOT. I feel like i have a pretty firm grip of closures and functions, so the homework should be do-able. 
Gonna look at this homework and then the next one which is about currying.

**Feeling** feeling a bit overwhelmed, but i am excited to see how this develops me

### Day 7: July 27,Tuesday 

** What I Learnt Today** Finished my Cloning objects homework and learned how to shallow copy objects with the Spread Operator(...object/array) and also deep copy things with JSON.parse(JSON.stringify()).
Pretty good practice and good stuff to know to reuse objects in different ways.

**Feeling** Pretty Good ready for class tomorrow

### Days 8: July 28, Wednesday

**What I learnt Today** Today I learned about Callbacks, where functions are passed in other functions' arguments then executed. 
I also learned how to create a repository in Github and setup the upload to the master repository.

**Thoughts** things are kinda coalescing together, from passing different things into functions arguments to make more higher functioning code. I just need to remember when to use which.

**Feeling** Class is really ramping up, so that stressing feeling of being overwhelmed isn't really going away,especially with the Hangman project starting. But I am eager to work on it,
especially since it is do on 8/16 so I have time.

### Day 9: August 9, Monday

**What I learnt Today** Today I learnt about the DOM (Document Object Model) and how to access and put code there. Also learned how to target certain HTML elements in the DOM
document.querySelector in the Debugger tools.

**Thoughts** getting back into the swing of things. Going to use Mimo more as well as do side projects so I can really contextualize this information

**feeling** moderately confident in what I am learning and finishing the project

### Day 10: Agust 10, Tuesday 

**What I learnt Today** Practiced more in the DOM, learnt how to get nested Items in the with document.querySelector().
can use spaces to specify to jquery where you are trying to pull from, then call the descendant that you specifically want from that particular nest.
Also how to connect a js file to an html so that it does not load to the web page first <script src=your.js defer></script> 

**Thoughts** all around felt like a pretty productive day, finished the homework and learned alot more about the DOM and how JavaScript interacts with it.
want to put this knowlegde into a project. 

**feeling** need to make more stuff to really build the knowlegde
