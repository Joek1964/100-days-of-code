**Today's Progress**: I did a little bit of review in Freecodecamp.org (not much).  I learned how to use github a little bit better.  I looked up information about the NPM module "Forever" for node.js for a project that I am working on.  I did some bracket notation and concatenation for javascript. I built the webmail access feature for a backend office tool that I am building for a client.  I did about 4 hours of code study and one hour of actual code.  

**Thoughts:** Code study does not count as actual code.  However, I have to look up information to actually get the code done.  Does that count towards my coding time?  

**Link to work:** My code for the project is private for a client.  I will begin to add code here as a git-commit to a new repo.  I will add that to my to do list for this challenge.
