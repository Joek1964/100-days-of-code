# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 12, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on Checkio.org and Leetcode.com

**Thoughts** I started coding in a Data Science Bootcamp and learnt so much about machine learning and so on. Now I want to become fluent in Python. So I start with some bascis. 

**Links to work**
1. [Find the Child Who Has the Ball](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-child-who-has-the-ball-after-k-seconds/)
2. [Duplicate all Zeros in a List](https://py.checkio.org/en/mission/duplicate-zeros/)
3. [Non-unique Elements - Trim an array down to its non-unique elements](https://py.checkio.org/en/mission/non-unique-elements/)
4. [Even the Last - how to work with array indexes](https://py.checkio.org/en/mission/even-last/)

### Day 2: June 13, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through some exercises on Checkio.org

**Thoughts** Today it was a lot about how to handle strings and datetime format.

**Links to work**
1. [Extract first word - regardless of ., or '](https://py.checkio.org/en/mission/first-word/)
2. [Three words - check string for three consecutive words](https://py.checkio.org/en/mission/three-words/)
3. [Days difference - handle date format](https://py.checkio.org/en/mission/days-diff/)

### Day 3: June 14, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through an exercises on Checkio.org

**Thoughts** Today it was hard for me to figure out the errors in my code but in the end it worked. 

**Links to work**
[Changing directions - in a sequence of integers](https://py.checkio.org/en/mission/changing-direction/)

### Day 4: June 17, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through some exercises on Checkio.org and discovered the in-built function sorted()

**Thoughts** I worked again on handling strings and applying those methods. As well I was using a lambda function to access different dictionaries in a list, so I reached the next level of complexity of the tasks! That makes me very proud. 

**Links to work**
[Backward each word of a string without changing the order](https://py.checkio.org/en/mission/backward-each-word/)
[Find the most expensive products in a list of products - a list of dictionnaries](https://py.checkio.org/en/mission/bigger-price/)

### Day 5: June 18, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: I delved into the in-built function str.find()

**Thoughts** Sometimes I underestimate the power of knowing the in-built functions. So today I learnt a new one. 

**Links to work**
[Return string between markers](https://py.checkio.org/en/mission/between-markers/)
