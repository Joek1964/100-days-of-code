# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 19, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Setup the initial project. Create a client library for the weather. Attempt to connect to server as it runs.

**Thoughts:** I need to spin up a server when the integration tests start to run. Try this: https://www.danylkoweb.com/Blog/integration-testing-your-web-apis-FQ
