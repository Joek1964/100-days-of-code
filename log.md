# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 24, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Re-committed to the challenge, decided to focus on Rust, with a secondary goal of becoming more proficient with Git and GitHub. Forked the 100DaysofCode repo, cloned it down to my Mac, and made a branch to do my updates on.

**Thoughts:** Have some ideas about how I can learn Rust in a more structured way. Will use the Rust Book as a guide, but need to be more active in my reading of it, rather than slog through from beginning to end.

**Link to work:** None today
