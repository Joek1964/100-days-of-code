**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 0: june 10, january

**Todays progress** ive gone through lots of git documentation
                    ive learnt how to revert changes, create repo and even sync project between
                    local machine and my online repo

**Thoughts** ive only used git for my local project and ive not really gotten the hang of it quite yet
             but then ive read a few things today that i plan on practicing. ive only been able to used
             the dektop version of github to sync my files remotely but i plan on learning the command line 
             parameters

**links to work** none yet
