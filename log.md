# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 10, 2019


**Today's Progress**: Built first solution to Kaggle titanic competition using Logistic Regression. Score = 48%

**Thoughts:** Did basic data prep, made dummies, one hot encoded. Then deployed a basic model with no optimisation or customisation.


### Day 2: November 11, 2019


**Today's Progress**: Added more to the data prep pipeline with imputation of missing data for "Fare" column. Added RandomForestClassifier and submitted solution. Score _74%_

**Thoughts**: Trying to work on visualisations and understanding by using Seaborn to see insights before running model.
