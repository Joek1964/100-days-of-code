# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created hello-world repository on GitHub, created first edit and pull request, then commited. Created simple JavaScript statements in the Chrome console.

**Thoughts:** ihavenoideawhatimdoing.jpg

### Day 1: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did more JavaScript in the Chrome console. 

### Day 2: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read through the intro of "Automate the Boring Stuff With Python". Installed Python and did a few simple expressions in IDLE.

### Day 3: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started Practical Javascript on watchandcode.com. Starting to build a to-do list.

**Thoughts:** I want to work on getting better at web development, but then I also want to learn some Python for work. "Automate the Boring Stuff" seems really interesting, and would probably help me. I think I'm going to focus on JavaScript for now until I get the syntax down, and to not confuse myself with trying to learn two things at once.

### Day 4: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working on title casing a sentence in JavaScript (FreeCodeCamp Basic Algorithm Scripting #252). The first letter of each word should be uppercase, and the rest of the word should be lowercase. I managed to change the entire string to lowercase (easy enough), but haven't been able to figure out how to make the first letter uppercase yet.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I just stared at the requirements for this project for about an hour.
