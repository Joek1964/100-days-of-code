# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did a GitHub tutorial, did some Javascript FreeCodeCamp lessons.

**Thoughts:** I wasn't going to commit to #100DaysOfCode right away because I had other things I wanted to do first.  But if not now, when?  I feel pretty good about what I learned in GitHub and FreeCodeCamp.

### Day 2: December 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More Javascript FreeCodeCamp lessons.

**Thoughts:** Feeling a little weird about doing lessons instead of working on my codepen projects, especially given that I have not finished one of the projects.  But getting back into the swing of daily coding is important, and it's what I can do right now.  Should feel good about that.  I know I'll return to codepen to finish at some point soon.

### Day 3: January 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More Javascript FreeCodeCamp lessons.

**Thoughts:** Did an hour of FreeCodeCamp while Maggie drove from VA to NC.  Felt good to do the work.  But I also realize that, for someone like me with a background in C and C++, this stuff is a good refresher but remedial.  The hard part will be writing actual code.  Also, after an hour in the car looking at a computer screen, followed by 4 hours of driving, I'm kind of feeling car sick.

### Day 4: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More Javascript FreeCodeCamp lessons.  Investigated boilerplate code based on freecodecamp blog post.

**Thoughts:** Did less than an hour of exercises in FreeCodeCamp, plus some reading and reviewing of boilerplate for bootstrap.  I keep looking for the shortcut, but I think the answer is to go back to my codepen project and really work on it.  I'm feeling like I'm kind of making progress by doing lessons instead of finishing the Bootstrap program, but really I'm wasting time because I'm not really focusing on making my code work.

### Day 5: January 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More Javascript FreeCodeCamp lessons, with some coding this time.  Also did Safari BootStrap video course while riding bike.  Good overview, I have a better understanding.

**Thoughts:** The JavaScript exercises were good. They required actual coding.  Still kind of review but at least it was real coding.  The BootStrap course from Safari was interesting.  Showed some good concepts, but I'm still not sure I can replicate the capability in CodePen.  I need to either design up front, then implement in CodePen, or dramatically simplify my CodePen design.  I think it's too early to try to use Atom and the browser developer tools.  Need to learn the simplified CodePen environment first.  I'm happy that I gave myself permission to code during work hours today.  But I need to commit to more significant project coding if I'm really going to get enything out of this.

### Day 6: January 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More Javascript FreeCodeCamp lessons.  Only a half hour.

**Thoughts:** I got a lot done today, but I didn't get a full hour in.

### Day 7: January 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More Javascript FreeCodeCamp lessons.  Getting into dynamically creating and managing large data objects.  This is really cool stuff, there's a lot I can do with it.

**Thoughts:** First, these data objects are great.  I never really got good enough with C++ to use them, but I love the idea based on what I'm learning in JavaScript.  I'm getting inspired to create the data models for my chat bot.  The deal chat bot should be implementable straight from these coding principles.  Also, listening to some of my old coding tunes while coding was fun.  Brought back memories and got me pumped.

### Day 8: January 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Did a lot of stuff today, but none of it was coding.

**Thoughts:** Thought about coding all day but had a lot to do and ran out of gas before I got to coding.

### Day 9: January 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished a couple of FreeCodeCamp exercises, but got stuck on the syntax for accessing multi-dimensional arrays.  

**Thoughts:** I learned a lot and it was a good experience to work my way through the exercise, but it was also very frustrating because I've made such great progress in the past with these exercises.  I know this is a new capability that I don't have a background in, so I can't rely as much on past experience, but it's still frustrating knowing I didn't get all the way there.  I didn't look at the answer (assuming it's written somewhere in the hint section, like it often is).  But if I can't get some help I'll peek so that I can move on.  I know I'm close enough that my logic is sound, and once I learn the syntax I likely won't forget it.

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 10: January 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished @FreeCodeCamp JavaScript exercises and made good headway into Object Oriented and Functional programming.  Kids started interrupting me and I got to a point where I was guessing at syntax from context clues rather than learning the material to pass the tests.  So I'm giving it a rest for tonight.

**Thoughts:** I feel really good about what I've learned for JavaScript and the OOP stuff.  It's really compelling to me and very energizing.  I also watched a video series on Bootstrap today while riding my bike.  All of the stuff makes sense, and I'm sure with adequate time to learn the tools and concepts, I'll be able to do some really interesting stuff.  So I'll focus on using Bootstrap to upgrade my basic portfolio site to get practice with Bootstrap.  My goal will be to get a basic mastery of simple, functional front-end UI design.  Then I'll focus on algorithms.  I keep getting drawn to deep learning and AI, and specifically the study group.  Tney meet weekly on Sundays, and at other times as well.  Socially and content-wise, it really looks compelling.  The basic coursework includes setting up AWS server images, so I'm also intrigued with the notion that I can learn how to set up AWS environments.

### Day 11: January 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Got some things done today, but too many to-dos and I didn't get to do any coding.   

**Thoughts:** I feel like I've done zero hours, then 2+ hours for a couple of cycles now.  I'm not overly concerned, and I've certainly stayed with the commitment.  But I don't want to make this a habit.  There was no emergency that kept me from coding.

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 12: January 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent several hours on training and coding.  Great progress and more than made up for no coding yesterday.  I watched a coding course on FaceBook Analytics.  It has a full project write-up on Jupyter, with code on GitHub.  I also researched Jupyter, and some of the other architectural patterns that the presenting team pointed me to.  I also finished the Object Oriented and Functional Programming lessons in FreeCodeCamp and did several coding exercises.  I also looked up how to use console.log and got it working so that I could debug my code.

**Thoughts:** The training I did is a little past my current skill level, but very useful to know once I get a little farther down the learning path.  It was definitely inspiring to see that these frameworks exist, and I'm confident (maybe overconfident?) that I'll be well enough trained to use them soon.  The coding went exceptionally well.  I had expected to hit some stumbling blocks as I went through the last OOP exercises and got into the coding exercises, but things went very smoothly.  I really need to commit a little more time by coding every day.  I'm feeling  confident that I'll be able to start doing project work if I keeo at this.

### Day 13: January 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent some time on a coding exercise to see if a string was a Palindrome.  I spent a lot more time than technically necessary because I really wanted to explore different ways of solving the problem, rather than falling back on my non-OOP thinking. But I ended up using a couple of JavaScript methods and a for loop.  Ho hum.

**Thoughts:** It felt good to get through the code today.  This was, by far, the most complex code I'd done to date, and the first coding exercise that required me to do research and use the debugger.  So it was satisfying to get to the end.  My biggest problem (as it was when I was younger) is that I don't remember to be 100% consistent when I fix my code.  So I end up leaving bugs.  I don't update every instance of a variable when I make a change, or I have off-by-one errors.  Other people seem to be able to keep track of everything in their heads and write down what they need.  I make small mistakes that create big problems.  I'll need to think about code quality at some point.

### Day 14: January 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made huge progress on freecodecamp basic algorithm programming.  I spent a fair amount of time really testing and debugging my code to understand the context and syntax of the commands.  I went through something like 10 exercises, which is great progress.  They took me anywhere from 5 minutes to over an hour per exercise.  There was one that involved complex string manipulation in which I understood the context but couldn't get the code syntax right.  That one was the only one where I pasted in code.

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling very motivated and very productive.  I know I've just scratched the surface, and when I get to the projects I'll need to dig more into the methods and properties that I've missed or skimmed.  But I feel like I'm knocking the rust off my logic skills, and I'm learning syntax and structure in Javascript.  I'm looking forward to getting to the front end development projecdts.  I know I have a lot of work to do to get there, but with consistent effort to retain what I've learned and make steady progress, I think I'll be able to start becoming productive in creating web apps.

### Day 15: January 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I did a couple of exercises, but I got bogged down in "higher order" functions and "callback functions".  Specifically, filter, map, and reduce functions.  It's an amazing capability that I need to slow down and master.  

**Thoughts:** I got fairly frustrated with learning filter, map, and reduce.  I couldn't make sense of the supporting material on the web because there are several ways to implement higher order functions and I couldn't tie them together.  Also, the descriptions were very jargony.  I could solve the exercises with cumbersome for loops, and I've succeeded at that, but I decided really need to slow down and master this stuff the right way before moving on.  Partly because these functions are very powerful and I can picture using them a lot.  And partly because JSON and AJAX are coming up next, and I know they make a lot of use of higher order functions.  So I'd rather slow down a little now to avoid getting much more slowed down when I move forward.

### Day 16: January 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent the day studying object oriented programming (OOP).  Watched a 2 hour video series on OOP for JavaScript, which was very detailed and technical.  First hour I rode my bike while watching, which helped me get some exercise.  I spent several hours studying this stuff, and it seems to be coming to me slowly.  But I still don't understand the syntax yet.

**Thoughts:** It's less frustrating as I start to understand how complex and new this way of thinking is.  I get the complexity of writing code this way, and that the advantages and pitfalls of coding this way are very different from the procedural coding I'm used to.  I realize I need to take this slowly, work through it, and use it for all the freeCodeCamp exercises moving forward.  I may have to do some training on the side to understand the advantages and pitfalls of specicific approaches as I go.  I can't rely on my past experience because it's procedural in nature.

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 17: January 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I happened across an open browser tab that had the answer to my original question on OOP syntax.  I didn't understand OOP when I first did the search, so I didn't recognize the answer when I saw it.  Having spent most of the last couple of days studying, and coming fresh after a good night's sleep today, it made sense.  I'm still writing my notes but will apply this answer to my exercises and see if I can start moving forward on the FreeCodeCamp Exercises.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited by the possibilities but still a bit overwhelmed trying to make progress.  I can see the potential of OOP for JavaScript for what I'm trying to do, and I'm definitely out of my comfort zone.  But I can tell I'm learning, meaning that the potential I see is valid, and eventually I'll master it.  As frustrating as it is to be taking so much time to learn, I'm making progress and I feel good about my ability to ask myself good questions and direct my inquiry to get to good answers.  Instead of simply trying to find the correct syntax to complete an exercise, I'm taking the time to understand the context and committing to using it going forward.

### Day 18: January 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I did some thinking about my project but I didn't code.  Got busy with other things.  I think I was also a little mentally exhausted because of all the hours I've spent recently learning about OOP concepts.  I just needed a break, and to focus on some other priorities.

**Thoughts:** Coding seems daunting today.  I'm still very motivated to continue, but realizing how much I have to learn in order to feel good about moving forward just feels like a lot.  I also recognize that I have to reset my priorities and expectations in order to do this right.  I can try to "brute force" my way through the freeCodeCamp lessons and coding exercises, trying to rely on my procedural coding skills, but I know that approach will ultimately fail.  I need the mental energy to take on this new learning experience, and I don't have it today.

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 19: January 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I decided to go back through all the freeCodeCamp exercises that I've completed, and study the "get a hint" solutions in detail for the exercises I've already completed.  The first exercise I looked at, I had the same solution but the "get a hint" code was more optimal.  I learned a good lesson there, and it was quick.  The second exercise was written as a recursive function instead of a loop.  I spent a lot of time researching this approach, and I really need to spend enough time that I can make good use of it.  It may take a long time to get through these exercises.

**Thoughts:** I feel great about the learning I'm doing.  I really feel like it's useful, and it's stuff that I'm good at and passionate about.  But I worry that I'll get bogged down, and that I won't be able to produce anything useful for years.  I have so many other commitments that I can't focus on this full time.  I need to stay focused on the good feeling of learning and growing, and set shorter term goals, and let the long term work itself out.  

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 20: January 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent some time watching a video course on Immutability.  Very cool, opened my eyes to approaches that are way past my procedural code background.  Also went through a couple of the freeCodeCamp exercises that I'd completed procecdurally and tried to them functionally.  I got a few bits right, mostly wrong, but I learned some things by trying before I looked at the answers.

**Thoughts:** The question is how to proceed from here.  I really love the concepts I'm learning, but how best to retain and appluy them?  Do a bunch of short programs and hope I use them?  Take good notes and develop a style guide?  Pseudocode a project big enough to take into account all of the concepts and code, then refactor over time as I learn more?  I was really impressed with MineSweeper, maybe I should design a game to test my skills.  Or a game that simulates my deal model.  I really need to figure out how to capture this stuff.  I also feel like work is getting in the way of this stuff, but at the same time, I don't want to take time off and spend 8 hours a day on this stuff.  I need to learn in smaller bites and process the knowledge.

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 21: January 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Wrote my first exercise using functional programming!  I've been going back through my procedural programs and trying to convert them to functional programs.  I've partially succeeded, but always ended up looking at the "get a hint" answer in freeCodeCamp to get to the working answer.  I've done several and it's helping me learn, but it feels really good to get one without looking at the hint.

**Thoughts:** I'm spending a lot of time on just learning rather than pure coding, but I'm seeing the promise of OOP and functional programming.  It's exactly what I need for what I'm trying to accomplish.  So I'm going to spend the time. My hope is to refactor all of my freeCodeCamp procedural code, and finish the algorithm programming section, in the next few days.  I also hope to capture some of the rules of creating functional programs so that I can take a standard approach to coding these things until I internalize the structure and can think in functional programming terms the way I think in procedural code terms.

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 22: January Y20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished refactoring all of my freeCodeCamp simple algorithms and finished one that I hadn't yet solved. I'm starting to get a few of them without using the debugging console.  That's huge if I can get good at it.  The promise is that I'll be able to create error-free code quickly, which will make me very productive.

**Thoughts:** I'm getting excited, realizing that one week ago yesterday I was using procedural code to solve these problems and struggling to understand object oriented functional and OOP programming.  I'm far from fluent but feeling more and more like I can learn to "speak" functional language fluently over time.  I'm excited to learn it because I seem to be getting closer every day.  The fact that I was able to do a couple of very complex lines of functional code perfectly suggests that this is something I'll be good at.

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 23: January 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Didn't get much coding done. I was very busy with family stuff and was a little burnt out on coding after long hours of coding over the prior few days.

**Thoughts:** I needed the break and plan to get back at it tomorrow.

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 24: January 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finiahed all of the basic algorithm scripting in freeCodeCamp!  The last few exercises were done in functional code.  Now it's on to JSON and Ajax, then building a bunch of site portfolio projects.  I never really mastered Bootstrap, so I'm guessing after this unit I'm really going to have to focus on being able to produce projects.  Not sure if that will require tools (like Git and Atom on Mac) or I can get by with CodePen.

**Thoughts:** I'm far from fluent or natural at functional programming, but I do believe I'll get there with practice and the opportunity to ask some questions.  I'm still not sure how the syntax of some of these fucntions work.  I use examples to show me the syntax, and they work when I try them, but I still don't understand them.  I need to talk to the Learn to Code RDU leaders.  I'm sure they can explain it to me.  Overall, it's taken significant time to get through those exercises but I feel like I've learne a tremendous amount.

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 25: January 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I didn't code today, but I worked on designing the model I want to build, I watched a one hour presentation using Alexa to drive Watson conversations, I took notes and gathered questions from my recent coding experiences, I attended a Meetup on a code school being launched in Durham by one of the Learn to Code RDU meetup leaders, and I got invited to the local Meetup Slack channel.  I didn't get to ask my questions so I hope I can put them on Slack

**Thoughts:** The next part of freeCodeCamp is jQuery.  I've looked at it already and I hope it comes easily to me.  It's another front-end technology to learn, and I need to learn node.js and some back-end stuff.  It looks pretty short, and then it's more development projects and coding algorithms.  I'm guessing if I can complete those sections, I'll be done with freeCodeCamp.  I'll have to see, but there's a lot of work there and I want to get to learning Node, Watson, and building skills with developer tools.  I'll have to figure it out as I go.  But I'm making good progress and if I can get some good experience developing a freeCodeCamp portfolio, and then switch over to IBM Code, I should be able to transition from learning to code into building my ideas reasonably quickly.  According to the site, the intermediate algorithm scripting and development projects take about 150 hours.  So a few months of dedication to coding and learning the ropes and I should have a great working knowledge.  And I'm sure I can short-cut the process using IBM code and input from Aaron or Sean.

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 26: January 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Didn't code at all today.  Looked at the jQuery section a couple of times but just got busy with work stuff.  Thought about my programming goals and thought through some of the projects I want to build.

**Thoughts:** I'm finding I need mental breaks where I think more conceptually rather than learn new lessons or write new code.  So far it's been a healthy thing, because I come back to coding refreshed and ready to go.  There was one point early on (before my 100DaysOfCode commitment) where the lapse in coding caused me to stop for a week.  But I'm much more motivated now.

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 27: January 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I travelled and had meetings for work all day.  So no coding.  But I did talk to one of the execs that I ran into about my work doing full developer stack coding.  And I spent some time in the car thinking through my goals and how I describe what I'm trying to do.

**Thoughts:** I really wanted to code today, I'm back in the mindset.  But I knew I'd be traveling for many hours, and in meetings when not in the car, so it wasn't going to happen. But I'll make some time tomorrow, and I have the weekend coming up.  Time to get through jQuery and into building my portfolio and doing intermediate coding challenges.  Then I have to decide whether to stick with freeCodeCamp through advanced portfolio and algorithms vs learning tools and coding my deal model.  It's exciting because it's still January and I can see the path to that decision point.

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 28: January 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Did freeCodeCamp jQuery exercises.  They seemed very straightforward and I got through them quickly.  

**Thoughts:** The concept and code make perfect sense so far.  But I'm sure, like the other things I've done, it will be tricky making it work in actual code.

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 29: January 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: House full of guests today.  I did some planning on the right approach to all the portfolio projects I've teed up.  Decided to work on all of the front-end HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap first, and then work on the JavaScript and jQuery parts later.  I watched a video on Bootstrap to get supplemental training.

**Thoughts:** I didn't get familiar enough with Bootstrap to have a working knowledge.  I wanted to do supplemental training with a Safari Media course, but it requires setup of Atom and configuration of the CSS and Javascript environment, as well as Bootstrap.  I'm not sure I'm advanced enough to get all that set up, and I don't want to derail my progress in pure Bootstrap, which is supported with no configuration in CodePen.

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 30: January 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Decided to do the Safari Media Bootstrap 4 course, and risk the idea that I can get it configured properly.  When I looked yesterday, it seemed somewhat straightforward.  

**Thoughts:** I have been able to get the environment established and the basic code working, which the training video says gives me a template for all future Bootstrap projects.  That will be useful down the road, when I build standalone front end components.  I had to do some configuring to get things working properly (fist pump when I solved the problems) but my code is working along with the training code so far.  And I think I'm done with configuring, and now it's all about coding up the sample site.  So maybe I'm in decent shape.  If so, that's a major victory.  I still need to 1) move Atom out of the downloads folder and into the applications folder, 2) save the template code, and 3) identify the non-template code that will run in CodePen so that I can move code between CodePen and the Atom environment.  I also need to learn the Bootstrap Lint (code examiner), but I'm guessing I won't do that yet because it seems complex to implement and run, and it doesn't help with CodePen as far as I can tell.  Maybe get some help with using it at some point in the future.  IF I have trouble with Bootstrap, I may use it to help get guidance on my code.  I hope my code will be simple enough that it won't matter for the time being.

### Day 31: January 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Slammed with work, didn't code.  I really didn't even do much related to coding, like training or research.  Too busy.  I have to make up for it tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** I'll be traveling Wednesday, so with any luck I'll be able to code on the road a little.  I really don't want to get stuck not coding for days when I get busy with work.  I'm making great progress when I can give my time and focus to the work.

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 32: January 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Slammed with work again, didn't code.  Same as yesterday.  

**Thoughts:** My trip got cancelled and I got past my deadline today so tomorrow I make up for lost time.

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 33: January 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Decided to use the Bootstrap training video and template code to design all of the FreeCodeCamp layouts.  So I got the training template working in CodePen (it was already working in Atom), and designed the front end layout for all of the FreeCodeCamp coding exercises.  It took several hours to get through all the design work, but I have a very clear idea of what I need to design for most of the interfaces.  

**Thoughts:** I only got through a minute or two of the training video, and spent a bit of time getting my environment working across CodePen and Atom, and spent hours designing my web interface frameworks for all the front ends.  It feels a little weird to do all that work and not have any front-end code to show for it.  On the other hand, I have solid designs across a range of interfaces.  So when I go through the next few minutes of the video (coding up my rows and columns) I should be generating lots of lines of code.  Some good consistency across interfaces, but also some interesting variations.  So it should be interesting to get the code working for all of them.

### Day 34: February 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created my template file in Atomn for all user interfaces.  Also created a version in CodePen and made it a template.

**Thoughts:** I didn't create Pens for all projects based on the template because I have a feeling I may add to the template before I'm done.  I may end up going through the tutorial and personal portfolio before projects prior to committing to all the templating so that I have some headlights on what comes next in each step so that I can understand whether I'll be duplicating a lot of effort by templating my projects too soon.

### Day 35: February 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Set up the Bootstrap scaffolding for all my user interfaces.  Some required custom scaffolding.  Moved on to Typography in the tutorial, but haven't extended that code into the other projects yet.

**Thoughts:** This plan of doing all of the UIs for my freecodecamp projects is working very well so far. Hoping it continues to be productive.  I also today came up with the idea of putting to-do lists in my freeCodeCamp Trello entry so that I could just do one specific task at a time.  I used that method today and got through all the scaffolding of all my UIs, and checked all the boxes. I have another checklist (Trello lets me copy the prior list) named Typography.  I'm glad I came up with this, it makes it easier to code without thinking I need hours to focus. I can just do a little at a time and keep moving forward.

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 36: February 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Did most of the typography lesson in BootStrap 4.  I'm learning a tremendous amount by following a logn and coding with the tutorial.

**Thoughts:**   This is really helping.  Coded the tutorial but not any of my UIs.  I need to finish this typeography part of the tutorial before I try to apply any of what I learned to my UI projects.  But looking forward to the point where I can actually update my UIs for FreeCodeCamp.

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 37: February 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed typography, including the footer.  This will help, as I have problems with my footer for my portfolio and the typography successfully did exactly the things I had problems with.

**Thoughts:** I realize that Bootstrap has a bunch of capabilities that are built-in, and I really need to learn to use them rather than add content and try to format it.  I'll need to find a reference and try to use them in my projeccts.

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 38: February 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Built a table in the Tutorial web page, including significant content and formatting.  I also reviewed the sections on browser compatibility and mobile-first.

**Thoughts:** It's making sense and I'm starting to understand the Bootstrap approach and value proposition.  I didn't code the mobile-first but watched the videos and will do the coding next.  I'm getting a sense for how to think about approaching UIs with Bootstrap.  I like that it seems to be focused on building a device-independent functional framework, then filling in the content.  That's the way I'm sure I'll be developing UIs.  Not especially aesthetically-focused, but more focused on functional management of the back-end models.

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 39: February 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Recoded my portfolio page from scratch using what I learned in Bootstrap.  Got a solid draft complete.  It needs some formatting, mobile awareness, and some icons and forms functionality.  Sort of works in CodePen too.

**Thoughts:** I've made great progress and gotten as far as I can.  Now I need to continue with the Bootstrap tutorial and learn forms, buttons, and formatting so that I can finish the portfolio.  I'm also ready to start on the other UIs, at least the layout like I did with the Portfolio. Making good progress overall.  Will be good to have a day or two off this week.

### Day 40: February 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Developed the Random Quote Generator framework and typography.  Everything is pretty much functioning exept the Javascript.  Looks good, though plain.  

**Thoughts:** I need to learn more of the features of Bootstrap if I want to expand the UI design.  But I have to say I'm picking up speed, which is key for me.  I don't want to be a UI designer, because my feeling is that chat bots and tool integration is the future, at least for what I want to do.  I want to get through this front-end stuff as quickly as possible, while learning how to create usable, functional interfaces, and then move to server stuff so I can start building my model.

### Day 41: February 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished first draft (and some follow-up drafts) of all HTML in all 10 projects!  And it's not even 4:30 yet.

**Thoughts:** My goal was to finish drafting the HTML for all 10 projects over the weekend.  So I'm way ahead.  That means I can either continue with the Bootstrap tutorial, work to finish the personal portfolio (HTML/CSS only, no Javascript required), do Javascript algorithm exercises, or do Javascript coding of the 10 projects.  I feel like I should get the portfolio done and do some more Bootstrap tutorial work, then hit the Javascript project work hard.  Get as many projects complete as I can.  I can always do Javascript algorithm exercises later on.

### Day 42: February 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the Bootstrap tutorial.  Spent several hours going through the steps and learned a ton.  I also have good reference based on the code I built with the tutorial.

**Thoughts:** I spent from late morning to evening coding to the Bootstrap tutorial, with breaks only for lunch and to talk to a friend and attend a work meeting.  I can finish up tomorrow and then work on polishing my personal portfolio project to complete the submission.  I really need to learn how to use GitHub, save my code there, and commit my coding changes.  I need to demonstrate that I'm doing commits every day.

**Link to work:**

### Day 43: February 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Bootstrap tutorial.  Now I have lots of components of working HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  


**Thoughts:** I typed out most of the code samples by hand. It takes a lot of time but I get much better undersatanding of the code and what each element does.  I integrated them into my code files and debugged using the developer tools on the Crhome browser.  I used Git for images and to find related files.  Very rudimentary use of all the tools, but the fact that I'm using them is very helpful to get me into the context of using a development environment.  I can build on the code by using and modifying components, and I can build on the tools by using them to streamline my development process now that I have the basic steps working.

### Day 44: February 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent my time starting a Git Video training series.  It's a little complicated but I think I can master it.  I made decent progress.  

**Thoughts:** The tricky thing about Git is that it has a web interface, command line interfaces for Mac, Windows, and Linux terminals, a Git app, and integration into tools I use like Atom (and maybe other stuff).  So searching Google for answers to config questions may come up with answers for any of those.  So it's kind of hard to discern how to use it.  My hope is that the tutorial, which uses the command line interface, will allow me to understand the flow.  However, my preference is going to be to use Atom, unless there's some reason why that won't work.  Or at least use the app.  I'm not big on command line interfaces unless I'm scripting something.

**Link to work:**

### Day 45: February 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Studied Git on Mac on the command line and in Atom.

**Thoughts:** I did a bunch of Youtube videos as well as a tutorial to figure this out.  It seems a bit cumbersome but I'm sure that's simply because I'm not yet used to working with it.  I think once I have a few commits and syncs underway, and have all my local and GitHub repositories synched up it will all make a lot more sense.

### Day 46: February 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Did some Git reading, I understand it slightly better and have a better sense of what projects are.  But no coding today either.


**Thoughts:** Frustrating that I didn't code and that I'm not making real progress with Git.  I did come to the realization that I should create my Hello World ideal template with base.css and main.js, and then clone that to create the other projects.  Once I do that I can replace the HTML files for my FreeCodeCamp projects and save back to GitHub.  Will take some time to work through it all, though, and I didn't have that time today.

**Link to work:** 

### Day 47: February 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Valentine's day.  We usually don't make a big deal about it but Maggie did this year.  I was busy with work during the day and did Valentine's day stuff in the evening.  So no coding.  Just more reading.


**Thoughts:** I get that I'm busy, but I'm not THAT busy.  I'm intimidated that I don't know Git well enough.  I need to power through.  I've done some reading every day, and that's something, but it's not coding.  I need to re-engage.  Pushe myself to get something done.  I know I can do it, I just need to do it.

**Link to work:** 

### Day 48: February 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Watched some videos and read some blog posts.  I'm getting valid input and context and I'm learning.  But I'm not coding.


**Thoughts:** Several things came up unexpectedly today.  Work related.  I thought I'd have a few hours to code, but I didn't.  And then in the evening, had to be a taxi driver for the kids.  So no coding.  I was really excited that I took time off from work and got a ton done.  But not sure it paid off in the long run, since I coded four straight days and then didn't code for four straight days.

**Link to work:** 

### Day 49: February 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Got Git working in Atom.  Set up my portfolio and my Bootstrap projects in Github.  Updated the header HTML and CSS for my portfolio.  Researched images I could use on my personal portfolio page.

**Thoughts:** Feels great to have the system up and running.  I'm still not very disciplined about pulling from templates because I don't have enough experience yet.  I have to get into a flow and then clean up my environment.  But the great news is that I can create projects on GitHub, clone them, add my files locally, and update back to the server.  Then I can create branches, commit changes, and merge pull requests.  Great stuff once I get into a flow.  I've also put my code from Git/Atom into CodePen.  Just need to smooth out my process and keep cranking away at each project.  I'll get there.

**Link to work:**


### Day 50: February 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made tweaks to portfolio, searched for appropriate images for my video games.  Redesigned page to eliminate the contact section and add a video game section to represent my old coding experience.

**Thoughts:** I was frustrated at first that I didn't do much actual coding, but then I realized that managing images is a critical part of front-end development and this is important work.  I learned a lot and will require less time to manage the images next time around.

**Link to work:**

### Day 51: February 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**:Did some reading but took a rest day.  Didn't code.

**Thoughts:** Needed a break.

**Link to work:**

### Day 52: February 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**:Did more reading and learned some Git stuff but didn't code.

**Thoughts:** I should have spent more time on coding but didn't make the time.

**Link to work:**

### Day 53: February 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**:Travel day, didn't code.

**Thoughts:** Traveling and in meetings from early morning to late night.

**Link to work:**

### Day 54: February 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Cleaned up my code and Git environment, as well as local Mac file environment.  Did some CSS and HTML coding on my personal portfolio.

**Thoughts:** I'm realizing that I'm not really motivated to do the freecodecamp portfolio of programs.  I'm going to focus on functional programming and my AI model instead.  See where that takes me.  I have a better sense of what I need to do, and I have good development tools set up to support me.  So I should be in good shape to learn, even if it turns out I don't make progress on my AI yet.

**Link to work:**

### Day 55: February 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent several hours working on Javascript tutorials.  Learned some good concepts, did some javascript coding, and downloaded some code from the tutorial.

**Thoughts:** I really like the notion of "functional core, imperative shell.  The notion that the core rules are solid and consistent and independent of states, data, and variables.  Since those things can be passed into the core, along with functions, it allows the core to stay simple while the context-specific shell takes on the specifics of a problem being solved.  Looking forward to getting deeper into this.

**Link to work:**

### Day 56: February 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Watched chapter 2 of Learning Fucntional Javascript and took notes in Evernote and added comments in sample code

**Thoughts:** I don't know Javascript well enough.  But this stuff is very useful.  I need to iterate between learning these techniques and learning Javascript syntax.  Maybe do this tutorial and mix it with FreeCodeCamp exerciases to learn syntax.

**Link to work:**

### Day 57: February 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Went through tutorial on higher order functions, including first-class functions, passing functions as arguments, and returning functions. 

**Thoughts:**  I'm starting to get the hang of how the syntax works and how to create solid core code vs generic code.  The idea is that the more readable the core code, the less likely that bugs will be present.  And taking the non-core code out into generic or close-to-generic functions means that those non-core functions don't clutter up the core code and make it leass readable.  Plus, those non-core functions can be re-used.

**Link to work:**

### Day 58: February 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Watched Functional programming tutorial on Javascript and took notes, both in inline comments and in an Evernote-based review.

**Thoughts:** Very interesting stuff.  Tricky because it's all about how to write good code, and I'm not yet fluent in what I need to write. But I feel like it's very useful to learn both in parallel so that I'm learning how to construct good code as learn the language.

**Link to work:**

### Day 59: February 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Watched Functional programming tutorial on server-side Node.js, including asynchronouse functions like reading files and getting inputs from the client.

**Thoughts:**  This is very tricky because I haven't gotten to server-side programming or asynchronous programming.  I get the concepts but I expect I'll need to go over this material multiple times.  Having said that, the idea of functional programming makes perfect sense, and feels both reusable and easier to code and read, especially once a set of constructs and modules has been set up.

**Link to work:**

### Day 60: February 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Studied immutability (again, but with better context), recursive programming ("list eaters"), and other functional code concepts. 

**Thoughts:** I'm going too far down the functional programming path without the requisite skills to understand how to apply the concepts.  It's brilliant stuff and I'm committed to using it, but I need to switch gears and learn jQuery first.  I probably also should learn node.js and do some server side programming as well.  Then come back to functional programming.

**Link to work:**

### Day 61: March 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Had a cold, didn't get much coding done but I did do a JavaScript tutorial.  Picked up a few odds and ends.

**Thoughts:** I need to get better and I need to spend more time on coding.  I'm making great progress, but between being sick and having hours of training every day, I'm not doing nearly as much as I'd like to do.

**Link to work:**

### Day 62: March 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued working through the Javascript tutorial. Still mostly remedial but it covered some topics that I have read about and coded a bit but didn't experience coding, like regular expressions for strings and passing functions for some array methods like .sort().

**Thoughts:** This tutorial is working exremely well for me, partly because I'm sick and my brain isn't taking on massive new challenges, but more because it's reinforcing what I know while teaching me more about the context of how the language works.  And the ability to validate in Chrome tools is so exciting to reinforce the knowledge.  I'm thinking I'll finish this tutorial and then do the advanced FreeCodeCamp exercises.  Should be much more doable with the Chrome tools to test my approach to coding each exercise.  Then maybe hit the CodePen projects, or start back-end coding?  

**Link to work:**

### Day 63: March 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Cold still hanging on.  Plus lots of family activity today.  Watched more of the JavaScript tutorial, but need to start coding or it's just going to start being a waste of time.

**Thoughts:** Need to code tomorrow.  Hope this cold lets up and I feel sharp enough to sit down and do the work.

**Link to work:**

### Day 64: March 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finally sat down and did some coding!  Played around with manipulating arrays, array methods, and filter(), map(), and reduce().  Alos played around with functions, passing functions to functions, returning functions from functions, setting functions to values in variables and arrays, and closures.

**Thoughts:** Felt good to do some real coding.  I need to start applying what I'm learning to move forward in FreeCodeCamp.  Glad my cold cleared up enough that I could think.

**Link to work:**

### Day 65: March 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made some great progress on some of the advanced algorithms.  But the functional programming stuff is still killing me.  

**Thoughts:** I got it on the first FreeCodeCamp challenge, summing an array of numbers given min and max.  But I couldn't make it work for the next one - finding the items in only one of two arrays - and ended up with a for loop.  The next one - roman numeral converter - I'm still struggling with. But I haven't given up.

**Link to work:**

### Day 66: March 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I got the Roman Numeral converter working using functional programming!  2 lines of code and one variable declaration!

**Thoughts:** That took forever, and I'm still far from fluent, but I'm starting to get the hang of it.  Maybe I'll find out that Python or Ruby or something does all this stuff really easily, but right now I'm thrilled that I got a complex functional programming algorithm figured out.  Now (I think) I need to get better at this.  Or learn another language that does functional programming much more efficiently than JavaScript does.

**Link to work:**

### Day 67: March 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the properties and values of objects.   

**Thoughts:** OOP seems convoluted and strange. I know it makes sense when there are lots of objects to manage and manipulate, but this seems a bit esoteric and strange based on what I'm trying to accomplish.  Having said that, I'm sure it will come in handy at some point and it's definiteluy good to learn and know.  

**Link to work:**

### Day 68: March 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to use the breakpoints and step through the Chrome debugger.  Also made progress learning about how to evaluate keys and values of objects.  

**Thoughts:** OOP still looks really cumbersome in JavaScript.  I haven't looked at the answer yet, but I think I must be missing something fundamental.  This is way more clunky than it needs to be.

**Link to work:**

### Day 69: March 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent some time on the FreeCodeCamp exercise.  Still learning about objects and how to represent, manage, and evaluate them.  Not there yet.

**Thoughts:** I'm missing the capabilities that make this stuff useful. Not that it's not there, I just need to study more to figure it out.

**Link to work:**

### Day 70: March 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Didn't get much coding done, but found two new podcasts on coding, FreeCodeCamp and CodeNewbie.

**Thoughts:** CodeNewbie is a very useful podcast.  I'm glad I found it.  It really helps that I've identified coding as a passion and am more focused on it than entrepreneurship. 

**Link to work:**

### Day 71: March 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Listened to two CodeNewbie episodes (driving to/from silks class), which is giving me a good broader technical context.  I did the Marty Hall tutorial on objects, which is definitely helping with context around the value of objects.

**Thoughts:** Didn't code, but the context is really important.  Plus I just can't seem to manage to string together minutes to focus on coding.

**Link to work:** 

### Day 72: March 12, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Listened to codenewbie podcast and worked on Wherefore art thou exercise for FreeCodeCamp.  I also discovered how to stop the Chrome debugger.

**Thoughts:** Made a bit of progress and got more background on some web technologies by listening to the CodeNewbie podcast.  Starting to feel some forward momentum in learning JavaScript.

**Link to work:**

### Day 73: March 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Planned to attend the Learn to Code Meetup, but was so late (and couldn't find parking) that I just went home and coded.  Made more good progress on Wherefore art thou.  Listened to CodeNewbie podcast in the car to/from the meetup.

**Thoughts:** I was bummed to miss the meetup, but I was very excited to code.  I'm starting to slip out of functional programming and back into imperative programming, but that's largely because the FreeCodeCamp exercises are getting tougher.  I need to keep working through the JavaScript tutorial, but I also need to keep hands-on-keyboard coding.  So I may end up doing some for loops because I'm coding ahead of my skillset.  Just make progress, learn over time.  Functional programming will come.

**Link to work:**

### Day 74: March 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished Wherefore art thou and therefore allowed myself to look at the answer.  I also took on and finished the next FreeCodeCamp challenge, Search and Replace.  

**Thoughts:** I was close to doing search and replace without breaking the string into an array, but couldn't figure it out.  Once I got the answer, I looked up the answer given by FreeCodeCamp, and sure enough, there's a way to do it thats' simpler with functional programming, but I had no real idea how to find the right construct so I'd have been searching forever.  Glad I got it done.  I'm learning a lot from the process.

**Link to work:**

### Day 75: March 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed another FreeCodeCamp algorithm.  

**Thoughts:** It was hard to do it in functional programming, and I missed the method to manipulate strings and had do to it by manipulating arrays, but I got it done in a couple of hours despite a ton of experimentation and debugging.  So I'm getting better.

**Link to work:**

### Day 76: March 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed three FreeCodeCamp exercises.  

**Thoughts:** All strong coding efforts, learned a lot, studied alternative solutions after I solved these.

**Link to work:**

### Day 77: March 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the FreeCodeCamp algorithm on creating an array with no duplicates from a set of arrays passed into a function. 

**Thoughts:**  It was hard, I learned a lot.  Took a long time.  It was a bit of a letdown after completing three on Friday, but I'm learning and I need to focus on the fact that learning and challenges are why I'm doing FreeCodeCamp, not the ego stroke of getting through three and thinking I know it all.

**Link to work:**

### Day 78: March 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed two FreeCodeCamp exercises today.  Learned from both

**Thoughts:** I still can't figure out why I should manipulate strings as strings.  It always seems so much easier to convert to arrays of characters or words, manipulate them that way, and flip back to string.

**Link to work:**

### Day 79: March 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked hard on manipulating arrays using filter.  

**Thoughts:** Trying to figure out how to process one attribute in an array that meets certain criteria but not others.  When using filter, you need to recognize that you've already processed for that attribute and ignore it in future elements in the table.  It's really hard to figure out but promises to open up a ton of opportunity to use functional programming rather than loops.

**Link to work:**

### Day 80: March 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed five intermediate algorithm exercises, which means I completed all of the intermediate and am ready to do the advanced algorithm exercises.

**Thoughts:** Felt fantastic, I got something like 12-15 exercises done in five days.  Great progress and I learned a lot from the exercises.

**Link to work:**

### Day 81: March 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Focusing on non-programming stuff and doing tutorials today.  

**Thoughts:** But I'm kind of itching to do more algorithm programming while I'm in a groove.  It felt really good and I'm not burnt out doing it.  In fact, it's energizing because I feel like I'm learning a ton from doing it.
