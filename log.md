# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Set up 100-days-of-code repo and joined FreeCodeCamp. I completed 25 challenges related to setting up my account, HTML, and CSS

**Thoughts:** I had a lot of velocity since I did most of the stuff required for the first challenges already--but I needed the HTML review. I wasn't planning on starting all of this until tomorrow, but since I had the day off, I couldn't help myself. There were a few things I learned that weren't covered at Codecademy (or I forgot everything...)
