# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 28, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Deleted unnecessary files in one of my repos.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with deciding to nuke this project where it was at, and start from scratch in other languages (was PHP/MySQL stack, now going to be creating it in Node, React, Express, and MongoDB), getting GitHub up and running, organizing files into a folder structure that would work, and overall just not being a newb. It's hard not to feel like a newb. lol

**Link to work:** [Deleted create-dashboard-page branch](https://github.com/MafiaRealm/MafiaRealm/pull/6)

### Day 1: December 29, 2017
**Today's Progress:** I finished five of the Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

**Thoughts**: These took a little longer than I thought they would! I struggled a lot on the Title Case challenge. Eventually I was able to complete it in a really awkward and seemingly inelegant way, and then when I checked the solution, I was right: there was a much more elegant solution... in fact, all of the solutions were far more elegant. I learned about the charAt() function in JavaScript.

**Link to work:** [JosephWeaver/freeCodeCamp - merged Basic-Algorithms](https://github.com/JosephWeaver/freeCodeCamp/commit/850296712e43922447740e7b6cd1bcea61d67072)
