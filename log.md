# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 25 2021, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished the JetBrains Academy track: Python for begginers. I also began a new track, Python Developer, which also belongs to JetBrains Academy. For the start of the track I have selected the project "Coffee Machine" which has 6 phases and today I have completed 5 of them.

More concretely, not counting what I have studied today, the projects I have been working on today were: [Hangman: Stage 7/8](https://github.com/Carmoruda/JetBrains-Academy-Projects/blob/main/Python%20for%20Beginners/Hangman/Stage%207-8.py), [Hangman: Stage 8/8](https://github.com/Carmoruda/JetBrains-Academy-Projects/blob/main/Python%20for%20Beginners/Hangman/Stage%208-8.py), [Coffee Machine: Stage 1/6](https://github.com/Carmoruda/JetBrains-Academy-Projects/blob/main/Python%20Developer/Coffee%20Machine/Stage%201-6.py), [Coffee Machine: Stage 2/6](https://github.com/Carmoruda/JetBrains-Academy-Projects/blob/main/Python%20Developer/Coffee%20Machine/Stage%202-6.py), [Coffee Machine: Stage 3/6](https://github.com/Carmoruda/JetBrains-Academy-Projects/blob/main/Python%20Developer/Coffee%20Machine/Stage%203-6.py), [Coffee Machine: Stage 4/6](https://github.com/Carmoruda/JetBrains-Academy-Projects/blob/main/Python%20Developer/Coffee%20Machine/Stage%204-6.py) and [Coffee Machine: Stage 5/6](https://github.com/Carmoruda/JetBrains-Academy-Projects/blob/main/Python%20Developer/Coffee%20Machine/Stage%201-6.py)

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with some exercises, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Although I've been studying Python for a while now, it' s still quite new for me.
