# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Dec. 29, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Used Visual Basic with Excel in attempt to automate data parsing.

**Thoughts:** This is a mini-assignment from a potential employer. I know nothing about VB and am trying to learn via Lynda.

**Link to work:** NA


### Day 2: Dec. 30, 2016

**Today's Progress**: More work on VB and Excel project.

**Thoughts**: I found some helpful links online about using VB. Tried unsuccessfully to use them in my mini-assignment. Submitted what I had accomplished.

**Link(s) to work**: NA


### Day 3: Dec. 31, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Back to Free Code Camp curriculum.

**Thoughts** I have completed Caesar's Cipher but needed a lot of help. However, I have gotten better at algorithms overall through this section.

### Day 4: Jan. 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed API section of Free Code Camp curriculum.

**Thoughts:** This was basically a copy-paste section and I know I will have to go back over this when I try to implement for real.

**Link to work:** https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/trigger-click-events-with-jquery plus 6 more lessons


### Day 5: Jan. 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Messed around with jQuery and worked on Random Quote Machine. Realized I will use an API for random quotes.

**Thoughts**: Good to review jQuery and rather than hard-coding quotes, decided to try using first API.

### Day 6: Jan. 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Went back over the API instructional section, took notes, and found the free API I want to try.

**Thoughts**: Time-consuming but also time well-spent.

###Day 7: Jan. 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More with API and Random Quote Machine.

**Thoughts**: Read about helpful advice on Free Code Camp forum for implementation. Also Bootstrapped all the HTML and CSS.

###Day 8: Jan. 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Jacked up 100 Days Of Code repo at least twice, so I spent time reviewing Git/GitHub. Also realized I needed to do housekeeping with this Log and to keep commits going to GitHub.

**Thoughts**: If I were pushing code to a central repo and wanting it to be merged, my repo would have been right. Instead I need to just set up and merge my own stuff, like I created my own Algorithms repo.

###Day 9: Jan. 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got $.getJSON and jQuery somewhat working on Random Quote Machine, plus minor CSS changes.

**Thoughts**: How to randomize quotes and not just pull one at a time? How to cycle through API's array? How to get Twitter functionality working?
