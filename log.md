# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 23, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Developed basic weather app using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The app had basic styling and functionality. The app background is dynamic based on the user input city. I will improve styling and look to detect the users current location.

**Thoughts:** This was a great project to start 100 days of code. Using existing knowledge and getting hands on with API's from the get go. I did have a bug which stopped the API call, however this was resolved after troubleshooting.

### Day 1: August 24, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Installed and spent time learning how to use GitHub and GitHub Desktop. I looked at commits, pull and push requests.

**Thoughts:** GitHub and GitHub desktop were both well documented and it was quick and easy to connect to my 100 Days of Code repo and create new folders directly from Atom.
