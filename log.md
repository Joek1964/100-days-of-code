# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Deleted unnecessary files in one of my repos.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with deciding to nuke this project where it was at, and start from scratch in other languages (was PHP/MySQL stack, now going to be creating it in Node, React, Express, and MongoDB), getting GitHub up and running, organizing files into a folder structure that would work, and overall just not being a newb. It's hard not to feel like a newb. lol

**Link to work:** [Deleted create-dashboard-page branch](https://github.com/MafiaRealm/MafiaRealm/pull/6)
