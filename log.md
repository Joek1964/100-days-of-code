# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 03, 2017 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the Odin Project's Web Developer 101 - Reconstructing Google's Homepage.

**Thoughts:** Worked on setting up the project with Gulp. We use gulp for most of our projects at work, but I had never got a chance to start a very new project from scratch which will define the gulp tasks. 
So decided to use this project as starting point. This project will act as my one-stop resource for gulpfile.js
Will start working on the project from tomorrow.

**Resources:** 
Not quite long back I stumbled upon this new developer [Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/me/). I find her articles very easy to follow and are most of the times what I need. She has written a nice article on [getting started with gulp](https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-gulp/). It's very basic, but will get you started.

Second resource, is from my all time favourite [css-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/gulp-for-beginners/). Although I didn't read through the entire article, it will be in my todo-list item for this weekend. Would like to improve my gulpfile.js.
