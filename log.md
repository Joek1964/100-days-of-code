#100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Uploaded landing page/ portfolio to github. Made edits to
project cards, fixed typos, etc.

**Thoughts**: I feel very insecure about putting myself out here, but I also
feel that I'm coding in a vacuum. I also feel that I'm not ready, since I don't
list every project I've completed for freecodecamp (fCC) on my landing page.
But-- better to publish and add features as I go rather than to never publish at
all.

**Update**: Tried to push my own master branch to the actual master branch.
Totally embaressed. Well, it's all roses from here, haha.

### Day 1: June 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Downloaded code for my weather app from codepen.io. Added
code so that it functions as a stand-alone webpage. Also, fixed the colors on
my wiki search app.

**Thoughts**: Looks like github doesn't count contributions you make when you
check in code from your master branch. I uploaded the new weather app, but it
didn't show progress. So I made some color changes on the wiki app, and pushed
that. Slowly learning git and making it secondhand knowledge.

Already, I'm doubting myself. I came home, fed the cat, sat down, and started
the pomodoro timer. That timer is what keeps me going, as long as I can start.

### Day 2: June 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on twitch app for freecodcamp front end project.

**Thoughts** : I've been able to get data from the twitch api, but now I'm
working through iterating through a list of users. Moreso, I want to define
actions, namely building a html status box, based on a user's online status. So
 far, not successful.

Did learn about ajax deferred callbacks, .done .error, and .then (which seems to
be a catchall). All learned that api's can block you for too many calls. Need to
figure out how to pause codepen.io's autorefresh. Codepen is useful for getting
these object calls and seeing how they return.

Was also very tired tonight. Full day of work, and then teaching, and then
coding. Almost feel asleep.

### Day 3: June 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continue work on twitch app for fCC

**Thoughts** : Still having trouble getting online status for each channel. I
can get the json's from the api one at a time, but when I check to see if status
returns an object with stream:null... blarg. I'm testing with a function call
using ajax, but the test completes before the function call does. Async. Blarg.

### Day 3: June 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continue work on twitch app for fCC. Start to add json for
projects for portfolio page.

**Thoughts** : Having troubles with javascript's async behavior. Going to ask
the fCC forum.

### Day 4: June 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learning much about javascripts asynchronus behavior.
Finally found a resource to help me understand. Refactored weather app's js to
try out new skills. No more nested ajax calls! But still, not perfect. Onto
learning about promises!

**Thoughts** : fCC forum is great. Its the stackoverflow for code noobs like me.
Going foward, I'll try to avoid callback hell. It will also help me pass data
around.

**Helpful Resource of the Day**: [net ninja async-js tutorial](https://www.thenetninja.co.uk/courses/asynchronous-javascript-tutorial)

   -**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

   -**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
