# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Tried working on a solution for reversing a string with a while loop. 

**Thoughts** I have seen numerous examples of solving this with a for loop, recursion and built-in methods. A while loop may not be the most optimal but I wanted to mix things up to see if it was possible to solve.
