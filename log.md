# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 18, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Built structure (HTML) for a form page.

**Thoughts:** I felt this was quite easy. The only challenging part was what HTML attributes to use while creating the form page. I realized the CSS won't be this easy though.

**Coding time:** Around 1 hour.

### Day 1: August 19, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Started working on form styling using CSS.

**Thoughts:** It was quite intimidating at first, because I didn't know which attributes to use. There are so many of them. But I decided to not fall into analysis paralysis and started to use the most common attributes and get my hands dirty. Overall it was quite a relief knowing I had understood some CSS topics such as box model, etc. I hope to learn more by doing and getting my hands dirty, without being afraid that I would fail.

**Coding time:** Around 30 minutes.

### Day 2: August 20, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on form CSS, studied other similar form structures.

**Thoughts:** My first session today, I got confused which attributes I should add because there are so many. I will do another one in the afternoon. I think my form is done.

**Coding time:** Around 45 minutes.

I missed a day. 21/8 was supposed to be my day 3 of 100 days of code but I forgot about it. I won't miss twice.

### Day 3: August 22, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Started exploring web development subject such as web layouts and display. Learned CSS floats and flexbox. Still copied other people's code but I managed to tweak something here and there, and noticing what happens when I tweak something. I learn by experimenting.

**Thoughts:** Today will be my introduction to deeper CSS subjects such as floats, flexbox, and grid. I've come across an SCSS code today and I felt amazed by the things it can do. What I felt today was something like being lost, then seeing a way out in the distance. I know the things I should do to make progress, whether I make it through or not will depend on my own consistency and will.

**Coding time:** Around 75 minutes.
