# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 21, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: React, worked on React's Functional Components in branches footer and main.

**Thoughts:** I worked on React's Functional Components: footer and main for both desktop and mobile views. I found it difficult to pinpoint reusable components for these two views, especially when one or another component was shown in the desktop view but not in the mobile view, and vice versa. It took me a while to identify which ones to replicate for both cases.

### Day 4: March 25, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: CSS and HTML, worked on improving my portfolio according to lab's guides.

**Thoughts:** I worked on setting the same margins on objects for all sections, making them all looks alike and centered. I changed my profile photo and changed my interests pictures for a quick and short list. I still need to find a plug-in to help me set animations based  on the page scrolling.

### Day 19: April 09, 2018

**Today's Progress**: CSS and HTML, worked on improving my previous pyojects so as to have them prepared for the talent fest at Laboratoria in Lima.

**Thoughts:** I worked on these projects a while ago and took me a while to catch up on what I did back then, and eventually fixed some things.

### Day 38: April 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: JS, worked on making navbar to show the active link according to the scroll position.

**Thoughts:**  I spend some time in finding a way to show the active link according to the scroll position, so I have to take into account the size of each section's dimensions so as to substrat that amount in each section in the code.

### Day 42: May 05, 2018

**Today's Progress**: SASS and JS, worked on transforming my plain CSS into SASS and rendered it back to CSS, as well as correcting responsive CSS in my plug-in for structuring images semantically along with its figcaptions coming from the ***alt*** property in HTML.

**Thoughts:** I enjoyed trying out the partials: variables and bases, where I could nest properties and mix it with variables, as well as using ***extend*** to reuse characteristics of previous classes while adding some new ones.
