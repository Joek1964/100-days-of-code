# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 14, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Setting up this repo and these Markdown log files for my run at 100 Days of Code.  Also created [New Twitter Account](https://twitter.com/absenth762) so I can tweet with the hashtag as required.

**Thoughts:** I will be doing this challenge with at least one other co-worker, which will make it easy to keep eachother accounable and to potentially help if either of us get stuck on projects.  I would like to livestream a bunch of my 1 hour sessions, but don't want to commit to livestreaming all of them.
