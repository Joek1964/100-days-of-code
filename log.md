**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: January 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I have completed pending Basic CSS lessons and commenced Advanced Visual Design lessons.

**Thoughts**: I feel great resuming the FreeCodeCamp curriculum with a fresh determination and commitment to _go all the way_.

### Day 2: January 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I have come across two html tags that I had never known about before; tag u for undelining text and s for striking throuh text.

**Thoughts**: So tired to concentrate on code after traveling almost 9 hours by road.

### Day 3: January 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I covered basic color theory lessons.

**Thoughts**: The lessons I covered today were interesting, however I found it rather boring to write code. I hope to be in better shape tomorrow and increase my tempo on the number of lessons per day.

### Day 4: January 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I covered more color theory, CSS linear gradients, CSS transforms, @keyframes and animation.

**Thoughts**: I had fun working through today's lessons. Am beginning to feel the urge to start practicing what am learning by creating hobbyist content on Code Pen.
