# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: May 3, Tuesday

### Here we go again. This will be my second attempt at #100DaysOfCode. My previous attempt ended on day 65 due to unforseen circumstances, and burn out. I will succeed this time!

**Today's Progress**: I forked and setup this repo. I have been working through the new revamped version of [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com). Many things have changed since the last time I worked on it. Many modules were added before the module I had worked up to. I am going back to catch up on those new modules now.

**Thoughts**: I'm excited and motivated to start on this again! I've invited my friend Chase to join me on this journey as well!

## Day 2: May 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on my Nightfox theme project.

**Thoughts**: I learned about semantic highlighting in vscode today. It gave me a lot more control on the elements I can style for my nightfox theme.
