**Today's Progress**: Started a new project to scrape the PGA tour website.

**Thoughts:** Re-familiarized self with BeautifulSoup and started playing with pandas.  Need to spend some time to really understand and pandas and get better at it. Not really sure where this project will go, but it's something I've always wanted to do and it's helping me get familiar with some new python packages.
