# 100 Days Of Code - Log
## rule 10:90
### Day 0: January 9, 2017
**Today's Progress:** finished 4 chapters on Eloquent Javascript adding several interesting codes on exercises, digested 2 workshops of Founder & Coders on week2.

**Thoughts:** Exercises on Eloquent Javascript were not easy at all. I enjoy reading this book as it really helps me recap concepts and terminologies I have been confused with. Pure function workshop was fun. Last night, I was coding in dream.

**Improvements:** Getting started early in the morning is the key. As I only give myself 10 days to grind the basic, I must speed up on reading textbook and workshops.

### Day 1: January 10, 2017
**Today's Progress:** Today, first I finished traffic light workshop. Then I worked on 3 workshops on API. I learned XMLHttpRequest is Javascript's way to make http to use http methods to communicate with a server. I installed postman. I could not finish third workshop.

**Thoughts:** I hardly remembered the materials so it is take a quite of efforts to catch up. I should focus more on learning in-depth rather than speed.

**Improvements:** Writing down codes on paper helps a lot. Also, I need to understand callbacks better

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
