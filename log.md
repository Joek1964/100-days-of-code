# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Jan 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started setting up the lambda server for brain of my bot which will automate mundane things like posting 100 days challenge social updates.

**Thoughts:** Setup Python3 env, Zappa and basic Flask App. Feels like it took 1.5hours to just setup and play with simple github API, need to improve my speed.

**Link to work:** Coming soon
