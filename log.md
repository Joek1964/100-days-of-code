# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 15: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created first Java project. 

**Thoughts**: My Java class starts next week and this is a new language for me. I'll take this long weekend and learn some basics before the semester begins.

### Day 14: January 12, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Working on onchange. Using that to get each option to fire and save the value to a variable.

**Thoughts:** Not much. Not a lot of time today to work on it. I did see an error in my code. No quotes around the ID in the getElementById.

### Day 12: January 10, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Took split check js into it's own file and tried to see where things were erroring out.

### Day 11: January 8, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Finished up FCC on Responsive Design w/ Bootstrap & Gear up for success and started jQuery.

### Day 10: January 7, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Very little, today is my birthday. About 15-20 minutes on Free Code Camp and I started watching a video tutorial from Udemy called: The Complete Web Developer Bootcamp - Beginner to Expert. Up to lectur 18.

**Thoughts:** Today was so busy. I made what little time I could.

### Day 9: January 6, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Fixed the input to string issue with parseInt. Added total bill section(tip & bill), added media query to remove the slider div on mobile \(sliders are hard on mobile\). In CSS, added new color scheme, changed the text input for the splitCheck to a drop down, 

**Thoughts:** I appreciate the lightbulb moments. I have so much to learn. The simplest things can throw you off course. Taking time away, giving it a fresh pair of eyes works wonders.

**Task List**
[] Get split check option to work
[] Add bootstrap or make responsive on mobile
[] Media Query to remove slider div on mobile 
[] Create favicon
[] Add comments to code
[] create my own 404 page
[x] Add a split check option

### Day 8: January 5, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I did my hour on Free Code Camp. 

**Thoughts:** A full day at work and teaching afterwards.. I'm just glad I have something to show some progress. Finished the HTML5 & CSS section. I also started revamping the Header and nav on my tip calc. That's something....right?

### Day 7: January 4, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Not much to speak of. Read some of JavaScript for Web Developers, then did my hour on Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts:** A little frustrated, a lot determined to learn more and understand. I won't stay away from the project too long. I know there is a lesson in this process.

### Day 6: January 3, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Not much to speak of. Still working in the console to 'see' what's going on. Coercion has caught me up. My input from my prompt( ) is a string and not a number.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm missing something. I need to read up more on coercion, so this makes sense and I can gain a working knowledge of why this is happening.

### Day 5: January 2, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Worked with Firefox Scratchpad to bang out a few scenarios. 

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling more comfortable about what the app is doing and I think I'm almost there.

### Day 4: January 1, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Seperated Check split from tip calc. Added js button to other page. I didn't upload to site, yet.

**Thoughts:** Adding the splitCheck to the tip calc broke the calc. I decided to move it to it's own page. I need to figure this out.

**Task List**
[x] Add a split check option 
[] Add bootstrap or make responsive on mobile

### Day 3: December 31, 2016 

**Today's Progress**: Configured a clear form button. Changed fonts and colors.

**Thoughts:** If you set the inputs to all have the same name, once you select a second radio button, the previous one will be deselected.

### Day 1: December 29, 2016 

**Today's Progress**: Changed the presentation and added radio buttons to select tip.
