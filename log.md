# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started a new project to scrape the PGA tour website.

**Thoughts:** Re-familiarized self with BeautifulSoup and started playing with pandas.  Need to spend some time to really understand and pandas and get better at it. Not really sure where this project will go, but it's something I've always wanted to do and it's helping me get familiar with some new python packages.

**Today's Progress**: Added functions into the main scrape.py script. 

**Thoughts:** Spent a lot more time trying to think of how to organize the code and how to format the list than actually coding.  Also got sidetracked playing with .vimrc.  Overall, not a very productive day.  Should spend some time playing with .vimrc in my spare time.
