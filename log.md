# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 23, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the website design course on FCC to build a piano.

**Thoughts**: This is an easy one, managed to finish in less than an hour. Nothing too difficult but just one specific thing I plan to check out tomorrow. It is a property called 'float'. It magically aligns the piano's white keys in a row. I though it would use flexbox instead, let's check it out tomorrow!
