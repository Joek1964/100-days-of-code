# 100 Days Of Code - Log
## rule 10:90

### Day 0: January 9, 2017
**Today's Progress:** finished 4 chapters on Eloquent Javascript adding several interesting codes on exercises, digested 2 workshops of Founder & Coders on week2.

**Thoughts:** Exercises on Eloquent Javascript were not easy at all. I enjoy reading this book as it really helps me recap concepts and terminologies I have been confused with. Pure function workshop was fun. Last night, I was coding in dream.

**Improvements:** Getting started early in the morning is the key. As I only give myself 10 days to grind the basic, I must speed up on reading textbook and workshops.

### Day 1: January 10, 2017
**Today's Progress:** Today, first I finished traffic light workshop. Then I worked on 3 workshops on API. I learned XMLHttpRequest is Javascript's way to make http to use http methods to communicate with a server. I installed postman. I could not finish third workshop.

**Thoughts:** I hardly remembered the materials so it is take a quite of efforts to catch up. I should focus more on learning in-depth rather than speed.

**Improvements:** Writing down codes on paper helps a lot. Also, I need to understand callbacks better

### Day 2: January 11, 2017
**Today's Progress:** First, I finished a workshop on getting data using Github api. I like chapter 5. higher-order functions on Eloquent JS and examples on filter,map,reduce and bind were interesting. Also I've made a plan for next week.

**Thoughts:** Writing many helper functions and passing functions as values/arguments is relatively new but very neat.

**Improvements:** I would like to share a quote I saw yesterday.Most people quit because they look how far they have to go, not how far they have come.

### Day 3: January 12, 2017
**Today's Progress:** I slightly grasped the concept of making instance of object and setting it's own property. (I plan to do another tutorial on object then go back to this chapter later and rather move on for now). After hitting the wall too much with my head, I worked on node girl workshop. There I finally understood that node is an environment which offers a large set of modules which enable Javascript to be written to communicate with a server.

**Thoughts:** It was a day of frustration but I came out better. I must admit that I am in a very good circumstance in no position to complain to learn new skills for a career shift. I will integrate the attitude of 'challenge fucking accepted'

### Day 4: January 13, 2017
**Today's Progress:** Today, I finished node girl workshop and learn GET and POST method to implement communication between server and client. node is really smart.

**Thoughts:** I found a pattern that I find a workshop which is to create a small working program much more fun than writing codes for learning a concept itself. I should start building a small program after 10 days.

### Day 5: January 14, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Learning about modularization and refactoring. I refactored a small CMS app workshop which I did yesterday. Server is by default at root level and backend logic is in index or app.js inside src file.  

**Thoughts:** I took an easy day today. After days of frustration in row, I had difficulty being focused on learning. Though think about this whole process as a module. You are building a small building block to create a big program every single day.

Day6: January15, 2018
Progress: understanding client-server and fs modules. Also trying return object with methods to reuse.
Thoughts: I was overwhelmed and frustrated by Eloquent JS but sometimes, let's just take one step back to go further. #100DaysOfCode

### Day 6: January 15, 2018
**Today's Progress:** understanding client-server and fs modules. Also trying return object with methods to reuse. Worked on refactoring for hours but it has not finished.

**Thoughts:** I was overwhelmed and frustrated by Eloquent JS. I am leaving the book after chap7 then come back later. Coding is more fun late at night.

### Day 7: January 16, 2018
**Today's Progress:** A program practicing api client-server/node.js basics. Finished refactoring by adding routes/handlers. 

**Thoughts:** Because of fail on Ubuntu, work pace has been interrupted. 100Daysofcode is definitely helps me stay motivated.

### Day 8: January 17, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Building a basic random quote machine. Learning properties of Date, setInterval and basic DOM. Tweet text from my own code :) "Short cuts make long delays.‚Äù   J.R.R. Tolkien, The Fellowship of the Ring. Getting used to write css and html. 

**Thoughts:** Though it was small, building something kept me motivated throughout the day. I've realized the importance of reading text line by line when googling.

### Day 9: January 18, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Fixed critial bugs in Random quote bg project related to recursive function/setInterval/clearInterval and also Immediate Invoking Function Expression (IIFE). Read YDKJS first book: Up and Going. Learned on Surge a free and simple deployment for frontend projects. Objects are cool.

**Thoughts:** I didn't get to do much today but fixing bugs was very interesting and also I feel like I understand a lot more while reading YDKJS compared to 6 months ago.
