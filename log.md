# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**
Tried working on a solution for reversing a string with a while loop. 

**Thoughts** 
I have seen numerous examples of solving this with a for loop, recursion and built-in methods. A while loop may not be the most optimal but I wanted to mix things up to see if it was possible to solve.

### Day 2: July 9, 2020

**Today's Progress** 
Was able to reverse a string with a for loop. Unable to solve recursively(need to get a better
understanding of syntax).

**Thoughts**

Today I've learned:
* `length` method can be applied to arrays and string
* Javascript follows the _lexical scope_ principle 
  * i.e. in nested functions, the inner function has access to both inner and outer variables. Whereas the outer function only has access to outer variables.
