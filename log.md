# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 19, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Setup the initial project. Create a client library for the weather. Attempt to connect to server as it runs.

**Thoughts:** I need to spin up a server when the integration tests start to run. Try this: https://www.danylkoweb.com/Blog/integration-testing-your-web-apis-FQ

### Day 2: April 20, 2021 
**Today's Goals**: 
* E2E testing using MSTest and launching in a single session (both the client and server)

**Today's Progress**: 
* Create batch file to launch server during E2E testing
* Got deserialization of JSON working properly via case insensitivity
* Got E2E tests working
* Got POST method for /Weight started
* Got SQLite in-memory DB working (returns version)

**Thoughts:** 
* What does the LAUNCHER_PATH environment variable do?

**Today's Goals**: 
* Spin up a SQL database from an embedded resource

**Today's Progress**:

* Implement POST on /Weight
* Store data in a database

** To Research:** 
* What does the LAUNCHER_PATH environment variable do?

* Discuss the role of architects in an organization
* Update Weight Table Schema. READ weight business logic and data built.
* GET list /Weight now works through the API
* GET by ID for weight now works.
* Rework E2E tests to leverage interfaces for the client
