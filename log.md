### Day 22 : February 1, 2016

**Today's Progress**: rails backend

**Thoughts**: did a lot of rails backend work
on myIRlog. Better understanding of routes and 
resources, and making custom routes. Definitely helpful.

### Day 23 : February 2, 2016

**Today's Progress**: rails backend + CSS

**Thoughts**: more rails backend, but also lots of 
CSS editing. Getting more familiar with quick
editing of style. All on myIRlog

**Link to work**:

### Day 24 : February 3, 2016

**Today's Progress**: rails backend + javascript

**Thoughts**: trying to make the CSS work with 
javascript. Things has simple as changing the highlight
on a menu bar. Frustrating to write so much code 
for something that seems so simple. Is there a better way?

### Day 25 : February 4, 2016

**Today's Progress**: new site + bootstrap

**Thoughts**: trying to integrate a bootstrap template
on rails. Copying files over didn't seem as easy as I figured 
it would be. So found this gem 'front-end generators' that sets up
some bootstrap templates with a few lines of code on rails. Super 
useful. All for Rights Forward.

### Day 26 : February 5, 2016

**Today's Progress**: rails backend and assets compiling

**Thoughts**: deploying to heroku caused the CSS and JS files 
not to show / compile properly. Spent hours debugging and trying 
to figure out why. Threw a bunch of console.logs in the JS files to 
see which ones worked and which ones didn't. Assets didn't compile properly
and read every resource online. Not sure what did it in the end, since
there were so many edits. But had to move around the require tree order, 
and manually precompile assets before pushing up.

### Day 28 : February 7, 2016

**Today's Progress**: got stuck on debugging node

**Thoughts**: having problems with node. Launched the server and 
it keps crashing. Ran ``lsof -i tcp:8080`` to check what was running,
and there were a bunch of connections open. Had to manually kill
them with ``sudo kill <pid>``.

**Link to work**:

### Day 29 : February 8, 2016

**Today's Progress**: same issues with node

**Thoughts**: same thing happened, only ``sudo kill <pid>`` didn't work.
Lots of connections opened had "CLOSE_WAIT" indicator. Only way I managed
to kill them was with ``sudo kill -9 <pid>``. Need to look into that more.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.
