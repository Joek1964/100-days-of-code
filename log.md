# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2018

<b>Today's Progress</b>: Started working through Free Code Campâ€™s Front End Certification Projects. I've finished 23 challenges so far.

I've also spent the last 3 days learning about git and github. On the recommentdation of @TheCooperMan (https://github.com/TheCooperMan) I watched https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9fIBT2NBGY. I actually did pretty much everything @ssaunier (https://github.com/ssaunier) did in the video rather than just watching.

<b>Thoughts</b>: I learned a few new interesting things particully about CSS, but although I'm excited about this journey I've started, as usaul I'm worried I will forget what I've learned just as quickly.

Putting that aside, what I've taken away most from these first few days is that the actual writing of code is only one task in series of potential tasks required in development: version control being another.

Looking forward to day 2!
