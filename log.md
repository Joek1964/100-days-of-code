# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Decembet 29, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Spent most of my time remember where I left off and familiarizing myself with building the Cal Poly website

**Thoughts:** I really need to stick to this and just finish it. That way I don't get discouraged from the time it's going to take me to ramp up every time I want to start.
