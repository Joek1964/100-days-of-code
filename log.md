# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Dec. 29, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Used Visual Basic with Excel in attempt to automate data parsing.

**Thoughts:** This is a mini-assignment from a potential employer. I know nothing about VB and am trying to learn via Lynda.

**Link to work:** NA


### Day 2: Dec. 30, 2016

**Today's Progress**: More work on VB and Excel project.

**Thoughts**: I found some helpful links online about using VB. Tried unsuccessfully to use them in my mini-assignment. Submitted what I had accomplished.

**Link(s) to work**: NA


### Day 3: Dec. 31, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Back to Free Code Camp curriculum.

**Thoughts** I have completed Caesar's Cipher but needed a lot of help. However, I have gotten better at algorithms overall through this section.

### Day 4: Jan. 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed API section of Free Code Camp curriculum.

**Thoughts:** This was basically a copy-paste section and I know I will have to go back over this when I try to implement for real.

**Link to work:** https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/trigger-click-events-with-jquery plus 6 more lessons


### Day 5: Jan. 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Messed around with jQuery and worked on Random Quote Machine. Realized I will use an API for random quotes.

**Thoughts**: Good to review jQuery and rather than hard-coding quotes, decided to try using first API.

### Day 6: Jan. 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Went back over the API instructional section, took notes, and found the free API I want to try.

**Thoughts**: Time-consuming but also time well-spent.

###Day 7: Jan. 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More with API and Random Quote Machine.

**Thoughts**: Read about helpful advice on Free Code Camp forum for implementation. Also Bootstrapped all the HTML and CSS.

###Day 8: Jan. 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Jacked up 100 Days Of Code repo at least twice, so I spent time reviewing Git/GitHub. Also realized I needed to do housekeeping with this Log and to keep commits going to GitHub.

**Thoughts**: If I were pushing code to a central repo and wanting it to be merged, my repo would have been right. Instead I need to just set up and merge my own stuff, like I created my own Algorithms repo.

###Day 9: Jan. 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got $.getJSON and jQuery somewhat working on Random Quote Machine, plus minor CSS changes.

**Thoughts**: How to randomize quotes and not just pull one at a time? How to cycle through API's array? How to get Twitter functionality working?

###Day 10: Jan. 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Saw Hidden Figures and was inspired to keep going with coding. Fortran, anyone?

**Thoughts**: Why am I doing this? What are my motivators?

###Day 11: Jan. 8, 2017
**Day Off**


###Day 12: Jan. 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Scrapped quotes API because I couldn't get it to randomize and return properly. Wrote JavaScript code for an array of quotes which are selected at random one at a time. Will use API for Twitter part of project instead.

**Thoughts**: Frustrated by this project that seems simple but isn't turning out to be. Happy that I got a quote to return at random from an array. Sad that I can't bring it into the view on button click yet.

###Day 13: Jan. 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Code is working for random quotes displaying to view! Helpful advice from Free Code Camp forum.

**Thoughts**: Getting quite an education by going through API documentation for Twitter. Very interesting. Taking notes.

**Link to work**:Twitter API info here https://dev.twitter.com/basics/things-every-developer-should-know


###Day 14: Jan. 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Encouraged others and networked. Making notes on security for tweeting quotes.

**Thoughts**: Glad to make friends online with other coders and developers. Networking is important although outside my comfort zone.

**Link to work**: Twitter Security info: https://dev.twitter.com/basics/security-best-practices


###Day 15: Jan 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Searched for free wireframe tool, downloaded WinSCP to start learning about remote hosting, and read more about Twitter API usage.

**Thoughts**: I need to prioritize. Finish Random Quote Machine in order to post to portfolio. Wireframe for possible part-time job. Both important.

**Link to work**: Twitter documentation, took notes


###Day 16: Jan. 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Twitter API objects, more reading and note-taking. Fascinating!

**Thoughts**: The Twitter database must be vast. So many object properties per account/tweet/entity etc.

**Link to work**: API overview https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api and subsequent section


###Day 17: Jan 14, 2017
**Day Off**

###Day 18: Jan. 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Tweets, Users, Entities, etc. More with API usage.

**Thoughts**: Concerned that it's going to be hard to capture the quote randomly generated and tweet it verbatim to a particular user's Twitter account. So much to think through and much to learn to execute this, probably.

**Link to Work**:https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/entities and similar sections


###Day 19: Jan. 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Typed up and submitted ideas about web design in general to potential employer. Tried to use Justinmind on lunch break but needed more time to do anything with it. Am considering whether Tweet Button could be used instead of REST API. Must keep moving forward and not over-think or overdo projects.

**Thoughts**: "Done is better than perfect," as the saying goes.

###Day 20: Jan. 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**:...was minimal. But also had a stressful evening and worked all day. Actually think I am almost there on figuring out how to tweet the quote. Some example projects have ideas that I can tweak to make mine work (I hope).

**Thoughts**: Need a day off to work uninterrupted. If I am here I'm "available" to my kids, partner, etc. Good thing I love them so much. <3 LOL

###Day 21: Jan. 18, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Finally found helpful code examples of how to tweet the quote. Got a window to pop open. Still working on JS and HTML to get it right.

**Thoughts**: Looking forward to my days off to get wireframe and other things done!

###Day 22: Jan. 19th, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Used Justinmind prototyping tool to finish and submit landing page mock-up to potential employer.

**Thoughts**: I never lose. I win or I learn. :)

**Link to work**: PrototypePBS.vp file downloaded. Uses Google Chrome Extension to render in browser.


###Day 23: Jan. 20, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Tried to get help online with Random Quote Machine. Can generate quotes randomly but not click Tweet button after. Or, can click Tweet button first to open a window, but no quote in tweet field (because I can't do that first and have button clickable). Argh.

**Thoughts**: Speaking of Twitter, this whole exercise has totally upped my Twitter game and I am highly enjoying it. Great tool for professional networking and information.

###Day 24: Jan. 21, 2017
**Day Off**

###Day 25: Jan. 22, 2017
**Today's Progress**: 2+ hours at Free Code Camp Meetup. Shared my Random Quote Machine and got feedback/ideas for how to get unstuck on functionality.

**Thoughts**: Met more coding friends which is always a plus. :)

**Link to work**: This is the helpful Stack Overlow article Ash found that might fix my problems! http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10486354/dynamically-change-tweet-button-data-text-contents


###Day 26: Jan. 23, 2017
**Today's Progress**: I think I'm going to abandon the widget idea and go back to hyperlink for TWEETING THE STINKIN' QUOTE.

**Thoughts**: Worked at Starbucks on my lunch break. More reading and asking for help this evening. Sigh. Still doesn't work right.

###Day 27: Jan. 24, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Hooray! Went to another Meetup through Girl Develop It and got feedback on RQM. I was so close to it populating the quote into the tweet field and two very nice developer mentors helped me get it working finally!

**Thoughts**: Grateful for helpful input. Also it made me feel better that it took lots of people a while to figure out why it wasn't working - so it wasn't just me. JavaScript is challenging for many people.

###Day 28: Jan. 25, 2017
**Day Off**

###Day 29: Jan. 26, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Submitted RQM on Free Code Camp & got feedback on it. Went back into Coding Dojo's learning platform.

**Thoughts**: Not much accomplished today. Picked up son early and really should remember that if he's home it's hard to get coding done. But that's no excuse. I didn't manage my time very well today.

**Link to work**: http://learn.codingdojo.com/m/7/3728/25130 beginning assignment using Pokemon API for practice.


##Day 30: Jan. 27, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Began writing code for Pokemon 1-156 images using PokeAPI assignment.

**Thoughts**:Some days are more challenging than others to carve out an hour to do this. PLus it takes self-discipline.

**Link to Work**: Have started a pokemonAPI.html file.


##Day 31: Jan. 28, 2017
**Day Off, my older two kids were in town!

##Day 32: Jan. 29, 2017
**Today's Progress**:...was minimal. Tried to work on Pokemon assignment in late evening. Bad idea.

**Thoughts**: I need to use the mornings for best work time. Need to be coding by 8:30 a.m. each day.

**Link to work**: http://pokeapi.co/ trying to use for loop to pull images from here.

##Day 33: Jan. 29, 2017
**Today's Progress**: actually wrote lines of code and got out old notebook to try to use for loop JS logic to get html img to show images 1-151 without hard coding.

**Thoughts**: This sounded easy but it's not turning out to be that easy.

**Link to work**: http://pokeapi.co/ still using this API. Getting a lot of 404 errors because I can't populate the correct number in the string yet.
