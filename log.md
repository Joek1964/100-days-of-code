##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

### Day 0: Jan 03, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Not really focused on a project. My progress is about getting near to Freecodecamp intermediate front end projects and 1.5 hours spent on it!

**Thoughts**: I begin Object Oriented and Functional Programming course on Free Code Camp. It was not that hard but there were a point that i struggled. It was about using *reduce* method.

### Day 1: Jan 04, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Worked with FCC courses not much progress but it was a busy day and i'm glad i could make some progress!

**Thoughts**: No idea what does a-b still do actually. I understand how it works but still it doesnt make sense to me..

```javascript
var array = [1, 12, 21, 2];
array.sort(function(a, b) {
  return a - b;
});

```

### Day 2: Jan 05, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Finished Object Oriented and Functional Programming course and begin to algorithms. 

**Thoughts**: Object oriented side is a bit complicated for me there are some gaps with how stuff work. Algorithms are a bit hard but it feels like doing something with coding. When i succesfully code the first algorithm it was very satisfying.
