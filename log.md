### Day 1: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did more JavaScript in the Chrome console. 

### Day 2: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read through the intro of "Automate the Boring Stuff With Python". Installed Python and did a few simple expressions in IDLE.

### Day 3: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started Practical Javascript on watchandcode.com. Starting to build a to-do list.

**Thoughts:**: I want to work on getting better at web development, but then I also want to learn some Python for work. "Automate the Boring Stuff" seems really interesting, and would probably help me. I think I'm going to focus on JavaScript for now until I get the syntax down, and to not confuse myself with trying to learn two things at once.
