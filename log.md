# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked through several user stories, features and bugs on portfolio.

**Thoughts:** Felt really good to break things into small pieces and knock them off one by one. Left with an issue getting image to hide on small displays with bootstrap. HTML is formatted terrible. Need to figure out linting I think.

**Time: 1 hour 40 minutes

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
