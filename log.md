# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 2016-12-30

**Today's Progress**: I went through the FreeCodeCamp jQuery exercises again then started the 'Show the Local Weather' FreeCodeCamp challenge.

So far I have HTML file with a couple of div's and JavaScript file that fetches the [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/current#geo) data with ~~hard coded lat and long values~~

I used [ip-api.com](http://ip-api.com/json) to get my geo data which I have struggled to have a separate functions so now its functions in functions.

**Thoughts**: Not a fan of jQuery, oh wait it's not that bad when it works, but $ this and $ that everywhere and functionception everywhere!

**Up Next**: Work with the JSON data and do some nice stuff with that!

### Day 1: 2016-12-31

**Today's Progress**: Looking at weather icons, still not sure on how to do this, I also had to change from using [ip-api.com](ip-api.com) to [freegeoip.net](freegeoip.net/) as [ip-api.com](ip-api.com) was showing me as ~100 miles away from my current location.

Completed Location, Weather type, and temp, ~~just looks like crap still!~~ 

Added a [random image function](https://gist.github.com/spences10/d48af132d0fc3f227e1c72733a356802) from flickr, added styling into the JavaScript looks ok on both my machine and CodePen :sparkles: :astonished: :sparkles:

**Thoughts**: Working with APIs is becoming a bit more straightforward with jQuery as long as there is a JSON object to work with. I :heart: the Chrome dev console! Has really helped me with debugging.

**Up Next**: ~~Style it yo!~~ Onto the next FCC challenge by the looks of it now!
