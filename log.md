# 100 Days Of Code - Log

# Round 1.

### Day 1: June 8, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Finished half the Basic JavaScript chapter from the Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification (300 hours) on Free Code Camp. Then finished the Applied Visual Design chapter from the Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours) (still on Free Code Camp). 

**Thoughts:** JavaScript is not my friend yet. I still don't really understand its use, eventhough I think today's work helped a lot. I rewarded myself by going back to HTML/CSS and learned a lot about it, and had a lot of fun. It's what I feel is missing from JavaScript right now, the fun. I hope it'll come soon. 

**Link to work:** No link... I twitted though (@MagaliMilbergue).


### Day 2: June 9, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Basic JavaScript chapter from the Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification on Free Code Camp. Then had a little fun with HTML and CSS. 

**Thoughts:** I guess I understand Javascript a little better. I even found some of the exercises to be fun. (Yes, I actually had fun with javascript ! unbelievable!). I still don't really grasp what it can be usefull for in web developpment.... I guess I'll get it later. 
I also got some suggestions on twitter on how to have a little bit of fun with javascript and better grasp its usefullness so I'm really happy about that. 

**Link to work:** No link... I still twitted though (@MagaliMilbergue).


### Day 3: June 10, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Continued studying javascript on Free Code Camp. Then went on and finished the challenges from the Responsive Web Design Certification. I also had fun with my cv, that I did in HTML & CSS as a way to practice what I had learned. I actually made a repository of it.

**Thoughts:** I did not have so much fun with javascript today, but I'm still learning the basics so I guess it's normal... I had a lot of fun with HTML and CSS though and can't wait to begin the projects of the certification. I already have a ton of ideas. 

**Link to work:** I guess the repository (https://github.com/TheDaisyMoon/mycv). (I'm not even really sure I'm using github right tbh)


### Day 4: June 11, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Only JavaScript for me today. Finished the second chapter of the JavaScript certification on free code camp. 

**Thoughts:** I did have more "oh my god that makes sense actually" moments today than ever. yay. 

**Link to work:** Twitted a little (@MagaliMilbergue)


### Day 5: June 12, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Finished the RegEx chapter of the the Javascript certification on free code camp. Also finished the bootstrap chapter of the Front End Librairies certification. 

**Thoughts:** I had a lot of fun with bootstrap, which was not a surprise... But the fun I had with RegEx was. And it was a good confidence boost which was needed after a week struggling to understand what is supposed to be the basics. I kinda want to find a little project in javascript to have more fun.

### Day 6: June 13, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Continued my learning journey with Javascript and began the first project for free code camp. 

**Thoughts:** Javascript was okay, I think I'm getting it a little better now, still a lot of work to do. The project is fun, it's a tribute page, doing it about Roxane Gay.

### Day 7: June 14, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Worked a lot on javascript and began to learn about jQuery. 

**Thoughts:** A very full day but did not feel very productive for some reason.

**Link to work:** Twitted a little (@MagaliMilbergue)


### Day 8: June 15, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Took my first break. 

**Thoughts:** I only read some articles but mostly stayed away from coding. It was my first no-code day since the 6th of May and I think I need it. I need to be more careful to not overdo it, burning out would be bad.

**Link to work:** Nope. 


### Day 9: June 16, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Finished my first project for Free Code Camp (the Roxane Gay tribute page), or at least did most of the work, I'll probably go back to change some of the design that I mostly left untouched. Also read a lot and began the Javascript30 course. 

**Thoughts:** It was nice to go back to what I mostly understand (the tribute page) and I am very grateful to the people that suggested that I did the Javascript30 course because I think it will help a lot.

**Link to work:** Twitted a little (@MagaliMilbergue) and the project is here [https://codepen.io/thedaisymoon/pen/rEOaeR#0]
