# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 21, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through my Twitch App Project on FreeCodeCamp. I get stuck applying the same solution for a different problem. So, I tried a different solution and it is working. Next, I'll use jQuery to activatethe nav-tabs and filter the streamers channels.

**Thoughts** Try different solutions for problems you think that same solution it'll works!

### Day 0: February 20, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Condition If Else implemented in my Twitch App to verify if JSON is null or not but it's not working. Maybe the forEach function or $getJSON can be asyn while it interating the array.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with getJSON function to the get the data at the same time. I need to see how to fix it to make my app works!
