# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 27, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Basic HTML and HTML5 course on Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts:** This was monotonus and boring, I realize now I can just finish the 5 final projects to get the certification and move on to the JavaScript curriculum.

### Day 2: June 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Set-up and started development on my new portfolio website. I need a foundation to display my projects and this will be a good start. I'm not aiming for anything fancy, just clean, simple, and to the point.

**Thoughts**: This was really fun when not building using restraints. No need to ask for permission on a color or particular style. I can just build and adapt. I should code for personal interest far more often, it feels good.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
