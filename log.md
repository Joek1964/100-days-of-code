# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 2nd, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
Completed CodeWars Katas:
1. Even or Odd
2. Surface Area and Volume of a Box
3. Remove String Spaces
4. Convert boolean values to strings 'Yes' or 'No'.


**Thoughts:** 
It was not easy to start as I couldn't decide what I should do first - start a bigger project or complete some smaller ones. Finally I decided to complete some CodeWars Katas as a warm up.

### Day 2: December 3rd, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
Completed CodeWars Katas:
1. Area of a square
2. Convert a string to an array
3. Grasshopper - check for factor
4. A wolf in sheep's clothing
5. Abbreviate a two word name
6. Fing numbers which are divisible by given number
7. Grasshopper - summation


**Thoughts:** 
Thanks to Katas I practice array and string methods, among others. Every day I feel that it is easier for me to find a better solution, although sometimes after checking solutions of others I can learn a lot and use better and much shorter solutions in the future. Plan for tomorrow - start to code some small project, maybe a quiz? I'm looking forward to it!

### Day 3: December 4th, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
Solved Leet Code problems:
1. Two Sum (number 1)
2. Palindrome Number (number 9)
3. Single Number (numer 136)

**Thoughts:** 
Inspired by YouTube video I signed in on Leet Code website and it made me so involved I've spent more than hour solving tasks. I completed three of them and started the fourth one but I still can't figure out the solution.
