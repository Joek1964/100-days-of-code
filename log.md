Day 1: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Hackerrank for bash scripting

**Thoughts:** I was trying to decide on a project to work on. I chose bash scripting because there is project at work that I have been wanting to work on that would parse and aggregate specific logs.

Day 2: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp and CodeWars

**Thoughts:** I decided to switch my focus because I didn't want to mix work with this project and get burned out. I decided to do FreeCodeCamp because I wanted to get back into web development. In late high school/early college I kind of ran the other direction from web design and development. I didn't feel like I was creative enough to do it. I still feel that way, but I would like to refresh my skills. I also would like to learn more about back end development. 

I work for a Big Data company and want to learn more about managing data. Python seems to be the language to focus on, so I've been practicing on CodeWars and Hackerrank.

Day 3: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** I started to get sick yesterday, so I skipped a day. I wanted to make sure I kept the momentum going. I mainly focused on FreeCodeCamp so I am more comfortable with Front End development. It seems like a lot has changed and CSS is more powerful... But then again, who knows if I was using it right back then. I just remember the coolest thing to do to your website was put a shadow on the text and place text on the page using div tags...

Day 4: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Set up git for this challenge. Started designing website I want to work on with my husband. Not much yet, but hoping to make some good progress on it.

**Thoughts:** There are so many options now to create your website. It is kind of overwhelming. Our site will start with blogging so I'm looking at WordPress and how I can take advantage of what it has to offer. The project may change though depending on what else I may learn along the way

#**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

#**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

#**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

#**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
