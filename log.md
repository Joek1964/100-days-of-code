# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 28, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Completely set up component file structure for my react app profile and started to transfer over info from my previous portfolio.

**Thoughts:** It's been about two weeks since school ended. I forgot some basics right off the bat and it's a terrible feeling so I'm glad to be doing this coding challenge. I need to get connected to more people so I can make sure i'm doing things correctly. Being outside the classroom environment is pretty scary but that just means there is plenty of room for growth!

### Day 2: August 29, 2020 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Continuing work on my portfolio. For some reason it's been difficult even adding photos from my o;d portfolio over to the new react one. I cant remembr if i'll need to set up the entire server side now but if so, it's going to take quitea bit of review!
