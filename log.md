# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 10, 2023

**Today's Progress**: 
- 1. Solved DataLemur 3 easy-medium level SQL questions,
- 2. Invested time in examining the @codebasics FMCG challenge. 
- 3. Developed the data schema for the database. 
- 4. Composed several queries to gain primary insights from the data.


**Thoughts:** I really struggled with structuring the database schema, understanding the primary problems of the FMCG business. Overall analysis was good.
