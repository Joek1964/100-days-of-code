# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 17, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started creating a personal website using GitHub Pages.

**Thoughts:** 

I focused a lot of my time on learning how branches work in git, and it was interesting to get to use something taught to me in my internship during Summer 2019. I can't imagine creating a project anymore without having _at least a testing branch_ instead of sending all the code to the production branch. I've made personal sites before, but I want this one to be simple and easy to follow, as I intend to link data analysis work I perform on the site.
