# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I did a small progress in my web app project on FCC. I just set the openweather API correctly and getted the JSON that I'm displaying on my page. Now I need to handle the JSON to complete the user stories.

**Thoughts:** When you have many tasks for to do, it is difficult to handle the time and sit down to code. I get stuck more one time, but I did in the last of the night. I did!

### Day 1: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I created a function to get the geolocation after read and understand the API, and another function to get the JSON from the API openweathermap. Also, I studied a little of the bootstrap documentation to set the jumbotron class as a card of my web app. I organized my code with some containers and <div>'s. With some inspiration to style the app it will look cool in some commits.

**Thoughts:** I notice the first part is start the day, but when you make that differently everyday with some motivation about "I need to improve, I need to fight with myself to be better". It was necessary read the APIs documentation again again and remember how works a method, a function, a jQuery handle, and you think if you are good enough to make the job. But when you see it is necessary to come back some steps to go up. Wow, it's awesome.

### Day 0: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I get the geolocation from the browser and I tested the openweather API for my project on FCC.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with JavaScript and JQuery, why? Because I've stopped for a long time without code anything. It's a piss off, really. Don't do that. Now, I need to recover again, study more to understand what I'm missing.

**Link to work:** I will up my repo for my GitHub.
