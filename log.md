# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3rd, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Started a new FCC project (personal portfolio)

**Thoughts:** I haven't really coded in a few weeks so i'm a little rusty, I'd like to get better at being able to figure things out quicker

### Day 1: January 4th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Added a bit of styling to the header and nav portions of the site, also added a few image placeholders for the work section

**Thoughts:** Today I felt a lot better about figuring things out, everything flowed a bit better once I talked myself through things.

**Today's Progress**: Pretty much wrapped up the portfolio exercise, just have to add it to code pen and submit it.

**Thoughts:** Things ran pretty smoothly, had no problem figuring things out. Satisfied.
