I am going to try for 2nd rap from today!  
I learned Linux command "nslookup".  
It is used to check the status of DNS server settings. And to check DNS-related setting in DNS clients.  
To use "nslookup command" , I need to install a package called "dnsutils"  

```bash
$ sudo apttitude install dnsutils
```
```bash
$ nslookup tatatamaki.com
