# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 4, 2021
#####

**Today's Progress**: Got development environment setup on Laptop since I had reformatted my hard drive. Started freecodecamp tutorial.

**Thoughts:** Think I'm going to start with doing some of the FreeCodeCamp tutorials.  Web development has always been a passion of mine and I haven't every really taken time to learn it beyond basic HTML and CSS. Today I accomplished the basic HTML section.

### Day 1: January 5, 2021
#####

**Today's Progress**: Took a little detour today and started programming my NVIDIA Jetson board.  I got the board all ran some example inferencing networks with TensorRT.

**Thoughts:** Started working on the [jetson developer guide](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/getting-started-jetson).  Left off with working on the [example C++ code](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/blob/master/docs/imagenet-example-2.md) to make my own recognition model.  Also uploaded my .vimrc to github so that I can get it to different development stations.

### Day 2: January 6, 2021
#####

**Today's Progress**: Got the imagenet model working with my C++ example and started on a CUDA tutorial.

**Thoughts:** The imagenet C++ example was ok, but didn't give me any exposure to the CUDA API.  Now workig on [this CUDA tutorial](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/even-easier-introduction-cuda/) and left off on the "Memory Allocation in CUDA" section.
