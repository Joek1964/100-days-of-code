### Day 6: January 8, 2017.

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp: Attended local group meeting and worked on group project.  Added bootstrap CSS to anewdev.io and modified it to have a vocabulary section of terms I have come across as a new developer.

**Thoughts:** I am excited that Angular was introduced as a new option for CSS and JS at the FCC local group, and we are building our project with it. Surprised me that Angular could be used as a CSS option as an alternative to Bootstrap.  Likely going to add it to my personal website, so that I can work with it some.

Looking at ways to implement Github directory directly to S3 so that I do not have to manually update my files on AWS.  Seems pretty involved, but want to try it because it will develop my skills even more.
