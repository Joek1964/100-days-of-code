data = "Basic data types in Python include integers, floating-point numbers, complex numbers, strings, booleans, and many built-in functions. (Courtesy https://realpython.com)"
loop = "A loop is a process that runs repeatedly until the fullfillment of a certain condition. (Courtesy https://techtarget.com/definition/loop"
lists = "In Python, a list refers to an array. A list, or array, is a 'sequence of several variables, grouped together under a single name.' (Courtesy https://cscircles.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/13-lists/)"
diction = "A dictionary is a collection of elements which is 'unordered, changeable, and indexed.' (Courtesy https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp)"

obj = "An object is a 'variable, data structure, function, or a method. (Courtesy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science)) Just about everythin in Python can be considered a method!"
clas = "Classes simply provide a way to group data and functionality together (Courtesy https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html)"
inherit = "Inheritance, a property of Python, allows the programmer to define classes, then later define more specific sub-classes that 'inherit' all of the parent classes characteristics. (Courtesy http://www.math.uaa.alaska.edu/~afkjm/cs110/handouts/inheritance.pdf)"
