# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Find out this challenge interesting, why decided to join it.
My main goals is to extend and improve my basic knowledge around modern javascript frameworks and tools, which are currently using across many companies, despite they are basicly build above vanila javascript). I mean React, Angular, Vue, Ember, Ionic and probably not from this list - Electron (found a tutorial on Corsetro, want to try it some time later) and in other side, I want to become a self-taught full-stack developer, which means, that I must make my knowledge in PHP (at least) deeper. But ideally I would to learn other backend language, for example Ruby/RoR.

### Day 0: December 29, 2017

### fireChat project
tutorial from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-j0LVc-zLh0
Created project from scratch via Angular CLI, set up services and a buch of components, which are will be a skeleton for chat. added necessary components from firebase and set firebase db up.
Also, struggling from unbuildable error atm (stopped at 20:01) - how it possible to build up app if my command line throw out error linked to empty (unmodified) services? also, Google recently updated their FireBase again, so all information in this tutorial is lightly outdated, so I must dig into google again to figure out how to make all DB requests up to date, like it was already with another app builded by Gary Simon from coursetro (https://coursetro.com/posts/code/31/How-to-Make-an-Angular-Firebase-Chat-App) which I tried some time ago

### Day 1: December 30, 2017

### fireChat project
 Finished up all tutorial parts, spent some time to solve problems with firebase2 (latest was 4.8.1, was need to downgrade it to 4.6.0 as mentioned here https://github.com/angular/angularfire2/issues/234#issuecomment-353481937), and a bunch of time to figure out all uncovered in tutorial whitespaces. Project works, but looks slightly odd. Think, some angular-material and infinite scroll fix this) but this will be implemented tomorrow, not now

and yeah, logo was found at freepik <a href="https://www.freepik.com/free-photos-vectors/logo">Logo vector created by Freepik</a> https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/flat-collection-of-fire-logos_1079897.htm

Implemented angular-material into app, refactored all components. Infinite scroll still pending for implementation


### Day 4, January 2, 2018

### JavaScript DrumKit project

Joined to parallel challenge #JavaScript30, and easily finished off first project to build native javascript script, which emulate drum machine. Found couple of interesting things, for example .addClass/.removeClass/.toggleClass functions without jQuery wrappers)
