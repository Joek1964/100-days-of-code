## Why am I doing this?

The past 10 years I spent on becoming a **really good scientist** and now I want to reach the next level and become a **really good Data scientist**.
So I commit myself on coding regularily and posting this on Github, that you can get an idea of my current projects.

The plan is now:
1. **code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.**
2. to commit it to the [Log](log.md) of this repo to keep you updated.
