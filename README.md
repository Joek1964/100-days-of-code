# 📅 I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge.

Given that I've been professionally programming for the last 10 years, I've found myself in a rut of only really ever coding at work. While this is fine, I don't feel like I' ve been developing my skillset anywhere near as much as I should.

Hopefully starting the #100DaysOfCode challenge will help me to work on projects in my spare time and give me the opportunity to experiment with new technologies I've been missing out on.

I've got a couple of bigger projects that I want to start work on, but I'm gonna start off small and see where I end up.

## 🛑 Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

### Main Commitment
#### *I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

##### Start Date
July 22nd, 2017.

### Additional Rules
1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23100daysofcode).
2. If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
3. I will push code to [GitHub](https://github.com/jacobwarduk) every day so that anyone can see my progress.
4. I will update the [log.md](Log) with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
5. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge.

### Even More Additional Rules
1. I will learn something new every day, otherwise the day doesn't count.
