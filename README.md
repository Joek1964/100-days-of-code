# I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge.

Given that I've been professionally programming for the last 10 years, I've found myself in a rut of only really ever coding at work. While this is fine, I don't feel like I' ve been developing my skillset anywhere near as much as I should.

Hopefully starting the #100DaysOfCode challenge will help me to work on projects in my spare time and give me the opportunity to experiment with new technologies I've been missing out on.

I've got a couple of bigger projects that I want to start work on, butI'm gonna start off small and see where I end up.

I'm also adding a new rule to the list:

**â€¢ Every day I must have learnt something new, otherwise the day doesn't count.**
